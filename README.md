# Comparative Analysis of Data Sets and Feature Importance in Predicting Hit Songs

This thesis delves into applying machine learning (ML) for predicting song hit potential
within the music industry, analyzing the performance disparities among distinct features
while addressing dataset structuring requisites. It introduces an innovative framework
involving regression-based methodologies for classifying songs into hits and non-hits. Additionally,
two heterogeneous datasets are presented, encompassing audio characteristics,
lyrical content, sentiment analysis outcomes, and emotion categorization. The investigation
highlights the key role of dataset scale and criteria for hit classification. The results
showed that the features popularity and danceability were the most useful in predicting,
emphasizing their importance in classifying hits. Finally, the study highlights the benefits
and ethical complexities of using ML in the music industry.
