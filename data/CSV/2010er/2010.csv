"Wake up in the morning, feelin' like P. Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
Now, now, we goin' till they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

All that ass hanging out

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Lined with casualties who sipping life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple Eve

The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them

Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends

Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight

And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this.""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho

But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

"You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Make it last

How come we don’t say ""I love you,"" enough

And we’re all staring down the barrel of a gun

Yeah, we gotta stop
Looking at the hands of the time we’ve been given if
This is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that
Every second counts on a clock that’s ticking
Gotta live like we’re dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or throw it all away
We gotta tell ‘em that we love ‘em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we’re dying

And if you plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
So when we long for absolution, there’ll be no one on the line

And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
Cuz there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
Cos all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
I'll be fine

Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations while debating up in barber shops
Young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here

I used to dream about, the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it, I made it!

Known from the city where no one believed in me
But I never give up the fight, yeah
But now I'm on top
I told you to let it rock (rock)

Verse 2
Rooftop, hella choppa burning smoke
Louie bag stay strapped wit a priceless globe
High life, flippin' and get some more
Paradise, the luxury marble floor
When I hit, hit me full of that cash
More money than I seen in a garbage can
Stunna island, money and the power
That's how we do it, make it rain, make it shower
Top floor, big timer doing big things
Over city views bought shawty new range
Flip another 100, poppin' throwing hundreds
In a new Bentley, uptown stunna

I made it...
I made it...
I, I, I made it...

Verse 3

Yo ay ay ay listen
See I don't live for glamor, and I don't care for fame
I'm in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change
They didn't believe in me
Then they calling my name
Now look who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then
But ever since I done gone platinum
Everything turned around
And now the sky is falling down-nnnnn

Verse 4

Came from the gutter, lookin' like my motha'
Made it to the goal line, straight out the huddle
Cash Money goldmine, Weezy stay loyal
Boy, we getting money like we just found oil
Uh and that's word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bed rash
And I just tell em to loaf it when the bread pass
Staring at you from the top of the game man
I might drop the world, if I change hands
Uh it feel good to be here, Weezy in the building, got this bitch rebuilt

is it the money, want me to give it back,
