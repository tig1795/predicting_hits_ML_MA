If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away

She'll eat your heart out

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
'Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending
With a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me

Been wanting my cake and eat it too, wanting it both ways

When I blew seep it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf

Pumped the villain and shit that say back

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we're just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got a mirror
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You have never met nobody that'd do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air and you leave for it
Till they have a cat scan on your mind and it's nothin' but me (on it, on it...)
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it, I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at

"I met this girl late last year
She said ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck

Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out

And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again

I'd have gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this seven thirty seven rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey

Got a little mile-high flight attention

I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain

On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her ""kiss my ass""

All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on, it ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
Kiss the past goodbye

Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost

'Til the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away

Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me round and let 'em invite a couple more
But before it goes too far
I'll let me down easy
'Cause tonight it's all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

Can I hit the freeway? I’m illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m lookin fuckin fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want the Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I'm dreaming of, as I bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

Hollis
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

ScHoolboy Q
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin’ portions of his liquor, water in the Patrón
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it and the vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what’s poppin’ at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ awe...some
swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Girl does she want it low?
This shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slide till the gas is finished, Q

Posted in the back, got my fangs in my grill...
Brooklyn brim, with my eyes sitting low,
And every boy in here with me got that smoke,
And every girl in here got to look me up and down;
All on Instagram, cake by the pound...
Circulate the image every time I come around;
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe...

Brought this all for you, just walk my way...
(Just tell me how it's looking, babe, just tell how it's looking, babe...)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim...
(And tell me how it's looking, babe...) How it's lookin', babe... (Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin' babe...)

Drop the bass - mane, the bass get lower;
Radio say speed it up, I just go slower...
High like treble, pumping on the mids;
No man ain't never seen a booty like this...
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I just write another one...
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker;

Red wine drip, filth, talk that trash;
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash...

Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c’est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent.
