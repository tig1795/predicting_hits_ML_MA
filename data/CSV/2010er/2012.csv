"Gotye:
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Kimbra:
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

"I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way

I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way

I beg and borrow and steal
Have foresight, and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

"Maroon 5:
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be
It's even harder to picture that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it but is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you

Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow, 'cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine, I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before, but all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights

Man, fuck that shit, I'll be out spending all this money
While you sitting around wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stunnin'

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top, or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for, Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

Wished I go away, got what you was looking for, now It's me who they want

In a year I don’t recall
It’s like my life’s on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn’t be long,
That was last November, now December’s almost gone
I’d apologize but I don’t realize what I’m doing wrong

And I never take that for granted

But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o ‘cause they’d a just been over it

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)

Make me your radio (Uh huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo (Let's go)

If I was an old school fifty-pound boombox ('member them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop?

And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear this, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
O-oh

Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo

I only pray you'll never leave me behind
Because good music can be so hard to find
I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote

Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you

To the land down under (Australia)

As my money gets older, their's get younger
They sell their soul, but the devil knows

Brushing past me all over my skin (skin)
I can't get enough, nough, nough
'Cause the beat keep pulling me in

Takin' me so high up, up, up
A place that I've never been

But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin

I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it’s going good

You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song

I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

Gonna cuss the morning when it comes
Cause I know the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
Cause you’ll have to leave

Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me 
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
