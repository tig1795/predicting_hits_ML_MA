"Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?

What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?

Ow, ow, ow

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Now, walk into the club like ""What up? I got a big cock!""
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop (Ho!)
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like ""Damn, that's a cold-ass honky!""

Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green (Ho!)
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Piss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!

Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch

Imma take your grandpa's style
Imma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)

Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board (Ho!)

Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like ""Ah, he got the Velcros!"" (Ho!)

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Ow, ow
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin? (Ho!)
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up (Ho!)

Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-
Up shirt, 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm that, I'm that sucker searching in this section (Uptons)

Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker (Ho!)

They be like ""Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!""
I'm like ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business (Ho!)
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't (Ho!)
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't (Ho!)
Man, you hella won't

Ho!

(Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah)

Ow, ow

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Ho!)

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big ass coat 
From that thrift shop down the road

I wear your granddad's clothes (damn right)
I look incredible (Now, c'mon, man)
I'm in this big ass coat (big ass coat)

What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit

We get up, fresh out, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, Sweater Gang
Nope, nope, y'all can't copy

Yup, bad, moonwalkin', this here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway and we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, I'm a I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four track, busing halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat crushin', labels out here

Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give that to the people
Spread it across the country, labels out here
Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give it to the people
Spread it across the country

Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you

Y'all can't stop me
I go hard like I've got an 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat
Like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week

(Raw! Time to go off. Gone)? Deuces, goodbye
I've got a world to see;
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes
So I'm giving it back to the people now
Sing that song and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment

I can't ever change without you

"Macklemore:
When I was in the third grade
I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight

I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?

A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like
""Yeah, I'm good at little league""

A preconceived idea of what it all meant
For those who liked the same sex, had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision

And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a predisposition
Playing God

Ah nah, here we go
""America the brave"" still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all His children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

Macklemore:
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself

When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
And that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen

I might not be the same
But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know

Macklemore:
We press play
Don't press pause
Progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can united by law
Kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful
Someone would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

"Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
I lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I died in Raleigh at least I will die free
