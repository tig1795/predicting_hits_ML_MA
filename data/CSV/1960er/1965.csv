Leaving just your picture behind (Ooh)

I'm tied to your apron strings

Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through and I try
But every time I see your face (Can't help myself)
I get all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts to flame (Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart)
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide

"When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go downtown
Things will be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure, downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go downtown
Where all the lights are bright, downtown
Waiting for you tonight, downtown
You're gonna be alright now, downtown

Downtown
Downtown

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares

All you left (all you left) is our favorite song 
The one we danced to all night long

Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning since you been gone
It's the same, same old song
But with a different meaning (Since you been gone)

Ah, oh, ah, sentimental fool am I (Sweet memories)
To hear a old love song and want to cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our hearts
Staying (Together forever)
Darling (Breaking up never)

(Now it's the same old song) Can't bear to hear it 
(With a different meaning since you been gone)
Oh, it hurts to hear it
It's the same old song 
But with a different meaning since you been gone

Precious memories keep a-lingering on
Every time I hear our favorite song
Now you've gone
Left this emptiness 
I only reminisce the happiness we spent 
We used to dance to the music (We used to dance to the music)
Make romance to the music (Make romance to the music)

"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic

Take me back, I'm begging please
Take me back, I'm on my knees
For you to scold me
Hurt me, hold me
Darling, take me back

When you belonged to me
I had a jealous mind
Too late I learned that you
Were not the cheating kind

(CHORUS)

My jealous eyes have learned
To take a look or two
They were too blind to see
That I was losing you

They say you live and learn
And though I've tried before
I promise never to
Be jealous any more

How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night,
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore,
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you

I just want to stop and thank you baby
