"Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have
Hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times 
I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not gonna be the one 
To share your dreams
That I am not gonna be the one 
To share your schemes
That I am not gonna be the one to share what
Seems to be the life that you could
Cherish as much as I do yours

Oh, I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters 
Just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind

Oh, I could say I need you
But then you'd realize
That I want you
Just like a thousand other guys
Who'd say they loved you
Like all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted 
Was to touch your face your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling
That I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

"I need love, love
To ease my mind

No, you just have to wait

But how many heartaches
Must I stand before I find a love
To let me live again

That keeps me hangin' on

It's almost gone

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy

How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness will cause my heart
Heart to break?

No I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on

Filled with sadness and confusion

Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who'll care
Always moving and going nowhere

The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy

I guess her folks brought her up that way 
The right side of the tracks she was born and raised 
In a great big old house full of butlers and maids

She says no one is better than I 
And I know I'm just an average guy 
No footfall hero or smooth Don Juan 
Got empty pockets you see, I'm a poor man's son

Can't give her the things that money can buy
