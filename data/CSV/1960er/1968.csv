"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulder

For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Na na na na na na na na na

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her (so let it out and let it in)
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with

And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Na na na na na na na na na yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin (Whoa!)
Then you begin (Fucking hell) to make it better

"I want to tell you all the story bout the Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""Mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

Well, the note said, ""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' 'round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the Secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't Widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother, I'm not fit

They robbed a store
And hightailed out of that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down

And made the graduation
Into the banking business

And laughed about it all the way home.

And the morning dew

"Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin 
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on his way his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices 
Talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

To make them feel wanted he's a good holy man

Tells them its all right

Mothers and fathers back home they will cry

But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate
As the young men move out into the battle zone
He feels good, with God you're never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage in the words that he said

The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength

Only time it will tell

With tears in their eyes

Remembers the words

"A long time ago when the earth was green,
and there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen,
They'd run around free while the earth was being born,
But the loveliest of them all was the Unicorn.

There were green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.

Now God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain,
And He says ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.""
He says ""Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do,
Build me a floating zoo. And take some of them...

Green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born,
Don't you forget My Unicorn.""

Old Noah was there to answer the call,
He finished up making the ark just as the rain started fallin.
He marched in the animals two by two,
And he called out as they went through, ""Hey Lord, I got your...""

Green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord I'm so forlorn,
I just can't see no Unicorn.""

Then Noah looked out through the driving rain,
Them Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games.
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring,
Oh them silly Unicorns.

There were green alligators and long necked geese,
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees,
Noah cried ""Close the door, cause the rain is pouring,
And we just can't wait for no Unicorn.""

The ark started movin, it drifted with the tide.
Them Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried,
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away,
And that's why you'll never seen a Unicorn... to this very day.
