"Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feelin', knowin' you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven

Darlin' I never showed you (no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (always be there)
And I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (but I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Yeah, and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way

And I know eventually we'll be together (together we will)

"For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through
Through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was
Loved by you, ooooh

You were my strength when I was weak (you were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me, oh

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love
Into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place
Because of you

You were my strength when I was weak (you were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (oh, when I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me, hey, yeah

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (my voice)

But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge
And I betcha my soul won't budge

Lil Eazy's long gone
Really wish he would come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go bye bye
All a lil thug could do is cry, cry
Why they kill my dog and man

And he shouldn't be gone, in front of his home
What they did to Boo was wrong
Ooh so wrong, ooh so wrong
Gotta hold on gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on (lean on)

for as long as I can remember.
You're all a real man can need,
and ever asked for
This is love girl.
This is more than a crush, yeah.

It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw ya witcha man
smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the Coupe with my hat turned back
we caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
so i skated off, as you strolled off
looking at the legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If this love is real, he's got to handle competition
you only knew him 5 months (that's right)
besides he drink too much, and smoke too many blunts
and I be working out everyday thinking bout you
looking at my own eyes in the rear view
catchin flash backs of our eye contact
wish i could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
i would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years, hey lover

hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)

I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
and i don't wanna violate your relationship
so i lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
still he can't stop me from having day dreams
tounging you down with, huh, vanilla ice cream
kissing on your thighs under the moonlight
searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
we would walk down the isle of destiny
what your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
that seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
but there's a deeper level if you'd follow I'll lead
Hey lover

Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

Last week I saw ya at the mall
standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
we talked about traveling the distant lands
escaping all the madness out here in the world
becomin my wife no longer my girl
then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
i kissed you softly and you yearned for more
we experienced pleasure unparallel
into an ocean of love we both fell
swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
fantasies interchanging with each kiss
undying passion unites our souls
together we swim until the point of no control
but it's a fantasy it won't come true
we never even spoke and your man swear he love you
so I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
keep my dreams alive until the right time

Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown.

Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown.

'Cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'll only pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

Only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
Only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up and blue
Only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder
If it will ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby yeah
The Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you","['columbia', 'south carolina']",342.9,99,1996,4.0,100.24,295,53,"{'neg': 0.11900000000000001, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.1733}",Only Wanna Be With You,0.5,Hootie and The Blowfish,18,24
