"Spoken:
Girl you know we belong together.
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this.
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see.

We belong together and you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind
Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye

Well I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' it 'round and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

Girl I know you really love me, you just don't realize
You've never been there before, it's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, (hmm) maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever, you and I

Can you love me again like you loved me before?
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me, don't let me down

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (can't let go, baby)

Spoken:
Girl, I'm here for you.
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella.
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you.
I'm here for you.

I'm not out to go out and cheat at night, just like you did baby
But that's alright, (Huh) I love you anyway.
And I'm still gonna be here for you till my dying day baby.
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me.
Will you just come back to me.
(Lonely) Yes baby my heart is lonely.
(Lonely) My heart hurts baby.
(Lonely) I feel pain too.
Baby please.

This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Come, (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)

"Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt
It is so big
She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, you know,
Who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her because she looks like a total prostitute, okay?

I mean her butt
It's just so big
I can't believe it's just so round
It's like out there
I mean, gross
Look, she's just so... black!

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung

Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed?
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes m-m-me so horny

Ooh, rump of smooth skin 
You say you wanna get in my Benz
Well use me, use me, 'cause you ain't that average groupie

I've seen them dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet, got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that

She gotta pack much back, so...
Fellas (yeah), fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)
Tell them to shake it (shake it), shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt

Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And uh, double-up, uh, uh

I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble

So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo

A word to the thick soul sistas
I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *breathing*
Til the break of dawn

Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on

So ladies (yeah), ladies (yeah)
If you wanna role in my Mercedes? (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
""Baby got back!""

Baby got back
Yeah, baby
When it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection
36-24-36 ha ha
Only if she's 5'3""

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups but please don't lose that butt

Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that

'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sister, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her

Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

So ladies if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT and kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Do you remember those special times

So much hope for material things

Talkin' to each other every night and day

Outta the country and into more country

Where the ghost of childhood haunts me

Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom

Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And you was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty...

I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire

I can remember when I caught up
With a past-time intimate friend, she said
""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me.""

She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring

An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning

Reality used to be a friend of mine
Caused complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
Guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone

She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do
I feel for her, I really do

And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big P.M. Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me

And dream our way out of this town

No one cared until the night she went a-walking alone
And never came home

Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

I swear I left her safe and sound

The truth of lust, woman to man

There are no secrets to make you move, set me free

Because something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet

If you can get it, it's worth a try
I really want it, i can't deny
It's just desire, i really love it

Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell

Because something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want

Just promise me
Whatever we say or do to each other
For now, we'll make a vow

"See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?

Outta nowhere comes a woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease

Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene

At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood

So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (Boo)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it

Well I stay calm and pray the niggaz leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me

I am everyday people, yeah
See I am everyday people, yeah

I told the niggaz please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude

And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him

Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

Ron had enough of being broke every day
saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
but soon as the case started moving slow
what do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
so he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!

Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
and the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch

Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
and a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
