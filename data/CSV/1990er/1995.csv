"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talking and where ya walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

I really hate to trip but I gotta loc'
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kind of G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasing dreams

I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool

Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living my life do-or-die, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?
The way things is going, I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spending most our lives 
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most our lives 
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'
What's going on in the kitchen? But I don't know what's cookin'

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

Been spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most our lives 
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl. 
I know you put all your trust
in me, I'm sorry I let you down. 
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
it can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please

Where you're breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown

La la la la 
La la lo lo lo lo oh
(This is how we do it)
La la la la oh

This is how we do it, it's Friday night
And I feel all right
The party's here on the West side

So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the Shaw 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo we made it!""

It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by

You gotta get your groove on
Before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (this is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (this is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flava (this is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be playa

You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
Hundred dollar bills y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64

Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe, let's keep in touch
Hey baby, let's keep in touch

But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

Why you wanna give me a run-around?

Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink it and always be full
Yeah, I will drink it and always be full

Oh I like coffee, and I like tea

Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone
Alone, all alone, why, alone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself, how did love slip away
Then something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone

Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running
And, girl, you know that I'll be there, I'll be there

You are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
You are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
You are not alone

You are not alone, you are not alone
Said again, you are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
Did you raise for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone, you and me, not alone

I guess it's time to say baby, baby 
How you make me feel 
When you come to my mind 
I can't keep my cool baby, baby 
I can't hold it inside

I can't wait each day just to see you walk 
Tryin' to move in close to get to where you are 
I'm not trying to be rude baby, baby 
Nothing ventured nothing gained 
Oh I'm telling you

(chorus)

Words just ain't enough baby, baby 
But that's all I can use to state my intentions 
Hope it gets to love baby, baby yeah 
It's a perfect situation

Cuz we fit together like a hand in glove

Oh oh yeah

"It felt like spring time on this February morning
In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though i am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has it's change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky (ooh la kah koh)
And I will wake up happy

As I lay me down to sleep (ooh la kah koh)

I would like to get to know if I could be
the kind of girl that you could be down for,
'Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me;
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

And if I don't let you know, then I won't be for real
I could be wrong, but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true,
There ain't no other, for me there's only you

I wanna be down, i wanna be down with you
No matter the time, of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on

I'll dedicate all my love, until you call me baby

And maintain to leave blood stains

But get popped like a pimple

More than a stealth bomba 
I cause drama, the enforcer

Or a 747 jet, never forget 
I'm the brother that keeps the girls' panties wet

With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick 
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

To take of this business I need to attend to 
'Cause my rent's due
And the rap gang's my meal ticket 
So you goddamn right, I'm a kick it 
Or get evicted

A black Casanova runnin' brothers over like Christine 
When I rock the spot 
With the flavor I got 
I get plenty of ass, so call me an astronaut 
As I blast pass another brother's ass who thought he was strong 
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong 
When I flow fools, know it's time to take a hike 
'Cause I grab the mike 
And flip my tongue like a dike

Hello

I wish I was little bit taller, I wish I was a baller,
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a 64' Impala

I wish I was like six-foot-nine 
So I can get with Leoshi, cause she don't know me, but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go and even in my dreams I can scheme a way to make her mine
Cause I know she's livin phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls and me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
Got hit with a bottle and I been in the hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame 
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses 
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach overcommeth 
By the thoughts of me and her together, right?

And everywhere I go, yo I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car, I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really whack
See I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night with the hood rats you can hold tight, but really tho' 
I 'm a figaro when I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well then I'ma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive
Cause it's hard to survive 
When your livin' in a concrete jungle and These girls just keep passin' me by

Makeup on their faces
Actors took their places next to me

The vendors and the dealers they crowded around me

Have I been blind
Have I been lost inside myself and my own mind
Hypnotized mesmerized by what my eyes have seen

Well I've walked these streets
In a spectacle of wealth and poverty
In the diamond market
The scarlet welcome carpet that they just rolled out for me

In the madhouse asylum they can be
Where a wild eyed misfit prophet on a traffic island stopped
And he raved of saving me

Says the man next to me outta nowhere

It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life

And we are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In the bar that faces the giant car wash

And the good people of the world
Are washing their cars
On their lunch breaks
Hosing and scrubbing
As best they can
In skirts and suits

They drive their
Shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company
The record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud

And he shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match
In an over-sized pack
Letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
He's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun

Get up your wit up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups flip up watch us rip up. 
Shakes shows until they fizz up
RZA like your with us if not zip up 
You lip up whip up.
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back cause we heard 
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters 
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin these since the seventies 
Find me so we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops the Naughty's troop in sections of forties

"Verse:
I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where to run
I needed to (wake up) and see (and see)
What's in front of me (na-na-op)
There had to be, a better way
Say it again, a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me
Chorus:
Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

Verse:
All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing every where I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sure enough couldn't have survived without you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me

"Oh, Why you look so sad?
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause I've seen the dark side too
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

So
If you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
But hey, what you've got to hide?
I get angry too
But I'm a lot like you
When you're standing at the crossroads
Don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you are wrong...

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

And when
When the night falls on you baby
You're feeling all alone
Walking on your own

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
(I'll stand by you) Yeah
(Won't let nobody hurt you)
I'll stand by you

Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

"Whenever I'm down, I call on you my friend
Helping hand you've been, in my time of need and so I'm
I'm calling you now, just to make it clear
What else can I do, won't you hear my plea

Friends may come and friends may go
But you should know that, I've got your back
It's automatic so, never hesitate to call
Cuz I'm your sister, and always for you.

Don't know what I'd ever do without ya
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So I call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes
And thats you as my best friend.

Whenever I'm down & all thats going on
It's really going on just one of those days
You say the right thing to keep me moving on
To keep me going strong, what else can I say

Friends are there through thick and thin
Cuz I've been told that and I believe that
It's automatic
Call me when you need a friend
Cuz I'm your sister, and always for ya

Don't know what I'd ever do without ya
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So I call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes
And thats you as my best friend.
(Repeat 1X)

I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
When you're going through (when you're going through)
Things that you may think have to meet a friend
You can count on me (you can count on me)
Call me when you need (call me when you need)

Cuz I don't know what I'd ever do without ya
From the beginning to the end

We could start a company
And make misery

Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see

Put me out of my misery
I'd do it for you, would you do it for me?

We could build a factory
And make misery
We'll create the cure
We made the disease
