"— Excuse me. Can I please talk to you for a minute?
— Uh huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
— Yeah, you do too... but um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named... you know his name
— Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name
— I just want to let you know that he's mine
— Heh... no no. He's mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?

See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make
It through the day, ain't that a shame?

Well, maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All of my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (confused)
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it girl, it's true

I think that you should realize
Try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have that you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture?
You're the past and I'm the future
Anyway, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (had about enough)
It's not hard to see (to see)
The boy is mine (that the boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special places in my heart
He was my lover from the start

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine

You need to give it up (you need to give it up)
Had about enough (about enough)
It's not hard to see (it's not hard to see)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)

I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up (not yours — but mine)
Had about enough (not yours — but mine)
It's not hard to see (not yours — but mine)
The boy is mine

I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me

"So open up your morning light,
And say a little prayer for right
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye

She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?

You look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
So breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now
So open up your morning light,
And say a little prayer for right
You know that if we are to stay alive
And see the peace in every eye

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over

"I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore,
Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for, 
When I say out loud, I want to get out of this
I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss?

I wonder
How it's going to be, when you don't know me
How's it going to be, when you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be, when there is no one there to talk to
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match, 
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch, 
A silence I can't ignore, 
Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in, 
Swings empty, 
I don't see lightning like last fall
when it was always about to hit me

I wonder
How's it going to be, when it goes down?
How's it going to be, when you're not around?
How's it going to be, when you find out there was nothing
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be

How's it going to be, 
When you don't know me, any more?
And how's it going to be

Want to get myself back in again, 
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt on your skin 
The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion

Say whatever you want but she still gon' get it up

Niggaz know, we go against the Harlem Jigalo
Getcha hoe, lick her low, make the bitch, hit the do'

Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways

Hoes of all complexions, I like cinnamon

Eat the mami chochi and drive her loca

Save money for the drinks, I'm about to buy the bar (yeah)
And everywhere I drive I'm a star, little kids

"Intro: (spoken)

I dedicate this record, the carnival to all you brothers takin' long
Trips down south, virginia, baltimore, all around the world, and your
Girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back. she's sittin' back
In the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in
Pow!, in the middle of the night, and this is what I told her for you

Chorus: (sung)

Every time I make a run, girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you got to understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til november
Said I'll be gone 'til november, yo I'll be gone 'til november
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til november
I'll be gone 'til november, I'll be gone 'til november
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til november
January, february, march, april, may
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til november, I'll be gone 'til november
And give a kiss to my mother

Verse 1: (sung)

When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother, go to school in september
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, jerry, wear his condom
If you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump
Woh oh oh oh
You sucker mc's, you got no flow
I heard your style, you're s-o s-o

Repeat chorus

Verse 2: (rap)

I had to flip nuttin' and turn it into somethin'
Hip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a punk (bing!)
Commit treason, then I'll have a reason to hunt you down
It's only right, it's rappin' season
Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice
Your voice, I'll make a hearse out of your rolls royce
Besides, I got my girl to remember
And I'll commit it that I'll be back in november

Like Sting I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films
'Kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a samurai

Gonna get a set o' better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon

That make me think the wrong thing

Lookin' for a man that would do me right
First move that I made was on the dancefloor
But got down one time, then I went down for mo'

Saw this young playa dip through the crowd
Looked over to my left and told my girl, hey
If I see him again I'mma have to say
And I'mma have to say

Lookin' all around doing all I can, damn

Then I saw him again standing by the bar
So far everything is going my way
Now that I found him I'mma have to say

Gotta do it fast or he'll be gone
Cuz it'll be just my luck 
That somebody else will scoop him up
Can't have that
Wanna be that girl that
Find herself a perfect match
Didn't wanna come off as bein' too fly

Said I know that you don't know me
But this might be my only shot at

He told me that we can do this
Cuz a girl like you I can't resist

Didn't need no game, just had to say

"Verse One (LaTocha):
I know you're going,
I can't make you stay.
I can only let you know I love you any way.
And if the road you take leads to heartbreak,
Somewhere down the line.
If someone ever hurts you,
Or treats your heart unkind...

Chorus:
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you.
You just run to these arms,
And these two arms will keep you warm.
When rain has found your heart,
Never fear, I'm never far.
You just run to the arms of the one who loves you.

Verse Two (LaTocha):
I want you happy,
I want the best for you.


And if you have to leave to find your dream,
I hope that dream comes true.
But if the world you find brings you hard times,
If someone makes you cry,
I'll be there to hold you,
I'll be standing by.

Repeat Chorus

Bridge (Tamika):
My love is strong enough, you know,
Strong enough to let you go.
But I'll always hold you,
Inside my heart.
And if you should ever change your mind,
You can come back any time,
And when you do...

"I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round, and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again, and then I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me
The heavens are sparkling
With starlight tonight

I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see

Here in the dark

It's out of our hands

I look at myself
And instead I see us
Whoever I am now
It feels like enough
And I see a girl
Who is learning to trust
That's who I see through your eyes

And there is so much THAT I'll remember

Yo, the sun don't shine forever

But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together

Better now than never, business before pleasure

P-Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight

So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin

(BIG: Turn that shit all the way up, yeah)
You know that I'm two levels above you baby

Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.

In a Commision, dont  ask for permission to hit em
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of ... (Satan) ... they say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under the vest by the abdominal
hum a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The mo shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White

To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggaz is at? (2X)
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

Verse Four: Notorious B.I.G.

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heatas n the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kids, Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggaz step up, we just macin them
placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Business rise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition
Nother day in the life of the Comission

you was trouble right from the staaaaaart,
taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it, and now
the arguments are gettin loud, don't wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed

Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do?

to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost

To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control

when we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love

... sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Now he left you with scars,
tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost,
trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh

but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

"Listen dear, 
I realize that you've been hurt,
Deeply, because I've been there,
But regardless to who, what, why, when, and where,
We are all precious in his sight.
And a rose still and always will be a rose.  

Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

There was a rose I knew, I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Ashamed of the way you lied, played with the truth, hey, hey

Mmm, she never knew what hit her
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears her thorns tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you and sees nobody else
And now you're so tough tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings

Oh..oh..yeah
When she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears her thorns tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby, girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see your all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow

Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself enough to know
That without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby, girl, you hold the power

See a rose is still a rose
Baby, girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you

"I long for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time

Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do

When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

Remember the nights
When we closed our eyes (we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do

When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do

When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same (It doesn't feel the same)

"Talking - I swear to tell the truth n nuthing but the truth. So help me God
I just felt like telling the story of my life. Felt like maybe
Somebody would be inspired ya know. We all feel pain. We 
all go through things But it's time to overcome all of that.

VERSE 1: Your plane crashed down in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldnt move
They called me a cripple, pops caught and attitude
Beat moms smoke lots drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage he didnt give a f**k
He sniffed some coke come home he beat up moms for talking on the phone

CHORUS: All I ever wanted all I ever needed was a father
Thats all (THATS ALL)
All I ever wanted All I ever needed waaaaas (WAS A FATHER) was a father

VERSE 2: Moms got tired of the beatings said ""yo we gots to go""
Packed up the bags we bounced out the door
She said ""I aint take these whippings no more I wanna live to see my little child grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Looking down at me  standing at me on the staircase
Hand to mother with a smooth goatee Make me wonder we he acted so ugly
Ya feelin me? (ya feelin me?)

REPEAT CHORUS

VERSE 3: My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dans siffed up an ounce
Grab the shot he left  long out for Queens
Possessed by a demon... A devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risks when
your moms comes home from a midnight shift.
she turned around hear the shotgun click
My pops said ""you think you can leave me?"" (Leave me?)
He blasted my moms in the back she fell down screaming I cant forget that
My Grandfather tried to close the door
He got shot 10 times in the stomach YO. Fo real

REPEAT CHORUS

VERSE 4: My head was spinning I aint never seen blood
4 years old this dont feel like love
Anyway Pops disappeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe that without him she's be dead
You know they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed righ thats word to mother (Word to mother)
Until i started getting beatings everyday
sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees i'd pray
Young child wishing the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat me wit belts like a slave wit a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest knocked me out on the floor
Thats just the tip of the iceburg look
its too long for a song
but perfect it for a book
Word is bond, thats real baby

Baby girl I thought we was down

'cause I really wanna stay

that I should share your underwear
do you really think he cares

Chorus
All this time I've been sleeping with you

and kissing him and hugging him
oh why you've been creeping with him
he's been sexing your friends
not I got you thinking about it
thinking about it thinking about it
thinking about it

Girl I think that I should let you know
that I'm gonna have to up and go
if you keep giving it up cutting up
and acting fast giving up the ass
I love you but I had enough
do it again it's gonna be your last
I can forgive but won't forget the 
things you did
you'll soon regret ever dissin' me
'cause this could be the end of we 
can't you see
girl you're hurting me

For the life of me I just can't conceive
why I just can't leave you
why you do this to me baby
I feel like a fool
but what can I do your love gots me weak baby
why must I endure your constant greed

Oh why tell me why whey are you so freaky
