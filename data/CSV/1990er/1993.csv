So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like the madman laughing at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track

Somehow I'm neither here nor there

"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To the river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep

I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I'd never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To the river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That is running to the promised land

In the middle of the night

We all start in the streams

Who are we to judge?
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
Or killed over a racist grudge

Is it his fault when we've gone too far

I've become blind

You seem illiterate to all my emotions
I stand corrected, how well you read
You speak the truth, you speak the me
You feel the love I have yet to find 
I know it's there, I know it's there 
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
Pathetic me, I long to be you
I think I'm close but i stand so far
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
I miss the love only 'cause they starve' 
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
I life and death my way through the sun
Where originates all the pain that leaves
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you

Well define my love with attitude
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
You can always tell
But I know remorse so well
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason

I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinking of you

Joni help me, I think I'm falling
It's not the love and I quest the why
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
The fear of pity is always awake
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
It's the windows, the doors, the passageways to the truth
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
In total recall as wild as the deuce
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
So superficial is the open wound
I caress the infinite light
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you

Well, define my love, that lives within you
Even when I die, it will sing to you
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason

And surrender to me (Everything wild)

"Break 
Shit
Yo
Yo, uh

Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked a breakfast with no hog (Damn)

I got my grub on but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
(What's up?) Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'
Thinking ""Will I live another twenty-fo'?""

I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night

Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
""Which court are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way like M.J.
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me

No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?

Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Little Joe

I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones and I'm yellin' ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day (Shit)

Left my nigga's house paid (What)
Picked up a girl I been tryin' to fuck since the twelfth grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the SuperSonics

I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep

Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube ""The Top Gun""
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion

I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams

No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning, got the fat burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a pimp."" (Yeah)

Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Halfway home and my pager still blowing up
Today, I didn't even have to use my AK
I got to say, it was a good day (Shit)

Stop this shit

Verse 1:
Baby girl (unfair but true)
Can love him once but not twice
Who plays games with no rules (a fool)
Tears for fears (are no surprise)
Happens almost every time
Love knocks you on your behind
(Loved you hard, loved you long, now his love is gone)
Love 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life
I've seen it time and time again
It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Chorus:
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, if it don't wantcha, you don't need 'em, girl, yeah
Give it up, turn it loose
Oh, you got to have

Verse 2:
Fact of life (so sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love, can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time, to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come
I've seen time and time again
It's not worth it, no no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good

Step from school

Break it down again
So those are my dreams
And these are my eyes
Stand tall like a man
Headstrong like a horse

When it's all mixed up
Better break it down

In the world of secrets
In the world of sound

It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new about you and your inner song
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground

I want to break it down

And these are my plans

Better break it down

In the world of sound

Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella save it for a rainy day
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground

I want to break it down

Pray to power

And they won't simmer, won't simmer, won't simmer down
