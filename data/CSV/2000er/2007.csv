And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me

Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin' you're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?

Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you

How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you? (nothing, no nothing)

Now little Lisa is only 9 years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why shes all all alone and they never met her family
Mamas always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listenin'
Mama is on drugs gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with laughs--usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mamas knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says shes 'bout to run away and never come back.

Why shes not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
There's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own

So theres no protection hes usin' no glove
Never thinkin' bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrows satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion

And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling
She's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

And while that sends you reeling
From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
And let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me
'Cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
(We'll carry on)

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
(We'll carry)
We want it all
(We'll carry on)

VERSE 1 (PLIES)
Soon As I Seen Her, shit Told Her I'd Pay For It,
Lil Mama the baddest thing 'round here & she already know It,
I pointed at the donk & told her this supposed to be yours,
Showed her a couple stacks & told her I'd let her blow It,
The hottest thing in the city baby you can't ignore it,
I showed her I was a real nigga & she went for it,
First time I caught her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back,
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right,
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe,
& opened her up & showed her what a real nigga like,
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night,
cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable To fuck up your whole life,
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice,
I call her my lil' bust it baby cause she keep it tight,
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice,
Whenever I wanna get off she know how to get me right.

I love to show her off, cause all the dope boys want her,

Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her,
Love when she act like she bow-legged & bend the corner,
She proud to be fuckin' me, cause I'm stuntin on 'em,
It feels good to be fuckin' a real nigga don't' uh,
Ain't called her in 2 days, gotta let her mind wonder,
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her,
That's why I don't mind breakin' her off, cause she ain't with the drama,
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff Lil' Mama,
You know she gotta be somethin' cause I done beat her under,
I'm baby snatchin' I'm tellin' ya, I promise,
I exposed her to real, & now she hate lame,

Think she double jointed from the way she splitted
Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it

She knows just how to move to seduce you
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop

Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin' her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride break it down-down-down
You know I like when you hike and you throw it all around

"She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad 
And she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad 
And she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's that and she knows
I think that she knows

Now dance
Little girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time

(Instrumental break)

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows

She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's that and she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's that and she knows
I think that she knows

(Instrumental break)

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned

I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh (repeat 2 more times)

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh

And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked
It just ain't fair, but I...
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh.","['boogie', 'contemporary r&b', 'dance-pop', 'disco', 'electropop', 'pop', 'pop and chart', 'r&b', 'synth funk']",608.4,96,2007,4.4,99.23,515,74,"{'neg': 0.10200000000000001, 'neu': 0.737, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9942000000000001}",Lovestoned,0.9,Justin Timberlake,25,47
"I think you can do much better than me 
After all the lies that I made you believe 
Guilt kicks in and I start to see 
The edge of the bed 
Where your nightgown used to be 
I told myself I won't miss you 
But I remembered 
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face 
And the way your innocence tastes 
And I think you should know this 
You deserve much better than me 

While looking through your old box of notes 
I found those pictures i took 
That you were looking for 
If there's one memory I don't want to lose 
That time at the mall 
You and me in the dressing room 
I told myself I won't miss you 
But I remembered 
What it feels like beside you

And I think you should know this

Wish I never would've said it's over 
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older 
Cause we never really had our closure 
This can't be the end

"I hold on so nervously to me and my drink 
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should

This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one

This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

But at the spot if you just think you?re gonna listen
You can drop it like it's hot
