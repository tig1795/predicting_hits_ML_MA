Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

C'mon

Shawty had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

I ain't never seen none that'll make me go
This crazy all night, spending my dough
Had the million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes, they stole the show

So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinking X&O
Hold up, wait a minute
Do I see what I think I? Whoa

Did I think I've seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain I'm making it snow
Work the pole I got the bank roll

I'm a say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me I gave her mo'
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

She had them apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)

Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Hey shawty, what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans filled with gwap and they're ready for show
It's Cadillacs, Maybach for the sexy grown
Patrón on the rocks that'll make you moan

One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I ain't dealing rubber bands

That's what I told her,
her legs on my shoulder,
I knew it was over
That Henny and Cola
got me like a soldier
She ready for rover,
I couldn't control her
So lucky on me, I was just like clover

Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Whoa shawty, yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that

I was on it sexy woman
Let me show it, made me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them rosé bottles foaming

She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop & lock
Had to break her off that gwap
Gal was fine, just like my glock

Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)

"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeah
But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing

Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around
Turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is somethin' wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing,
I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, before I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

And when I got home, before I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen door

When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know

'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar

When I peeped this little freak out
I was all on the bar when drifter Shawty Redd came over
Then she hit the floor, now

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips,
She's so right I'm gon' beat

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves although with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shit""

See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what they say you are - a superstar

Lupe Fiasco
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise 
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Lupe Fiasco
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow 
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autographed picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha ha ha ha...ha

You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center, clarity

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life

And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps until I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes.""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go!""

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes.""

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know

"It was 1989
My thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen
And she was far from in between
It was summertime in northern Michigan

Splashing through the sandbar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle

Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long
Turn it up

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves begin to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again

To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time
And you know he's gonna be there

Backed a border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

After many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones
Without reading innuendos

But you found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifter's run has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night

Now someone understand me

Practice what you preach

Once it finds a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

Take me away...
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away, like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city
Like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fucking reason.
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces. (My life!)
Cause that's Jesus people, and Game he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle (My life!)

So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson 'cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn I know his mama proud
And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like MJB, no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it outta town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty, like a glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

Walked through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on
Me and the devil sharing chronic blunts
Listening to The Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
They took so many of my niggas, that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, and my Sox hat
I'm Paid in Full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared

It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear, my dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know and 
The seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
What I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear,
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks when you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know and 
The seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things 
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine, when we're intertwined
Everything's all right

"She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining, saying ""I can't wait to turn 18""
She said, ""I'll make my own money and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school""
And she kissed her head and said, ""I was just like you""

You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast

In her one bedroom apartment and her daddy stops by
He tells her it's a nice place, she says it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
And daddy shakes his head and says ""baby, just slow down""

Dog's barking, phone's ringing, one kid's crying, one kid's screaming
And she keeps apologizing, he says ""they don't bother me 
I've got two babies of my own, one's 36, one's 23""

"A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like lunar landing
You make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

I find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz sounds just like a 'fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur
They're all the same

I never thought that I
Had any more to give

So much to be done
Don't you trick me out
We shall overcome
It's all left still to play

We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we're over here

Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time too long defending
You and I are done pretending
