Peace up!
A town down!


Yeah, yeah, okay! Usher.
Lil John!


Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.


Let's go.


I'm in the club with my homies
Tryin' to get a little V-I
Keep it down on the low key
'Cause you know how it feels

I said shawty she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' my ear
You would think that she knew me
So we decided to chill

Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow


Watch out! 
Watch out!


She was sayin' ""Come get me""
So I got up and followed her to the flooor
She said ""Baby let's go""
When I told her I said.

Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might be a good idea
To take her with me, (with me)
'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave now)

Now I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a 1-to-10
She's a certified 20
But that just ain't me, hey

'Cause I don't know if I take that chance
Just where is it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Makes shorty all right with me

The way she getting low!
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
And I said

Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah


Watch out! My outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And Rowl!  These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow

Forget about the game, I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes

I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put 'em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris feel cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say


Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah

See it's burning me to hold onto this

What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just

"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again 
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me

Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)

We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies

Listen, we don't pay admission and bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor, reckless, check it, said it

Like my necklace, started relaxin'
Now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga
Flows just changed now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back, c'mon

Now we livin' better now, Gucci sweater now
And that G4 could fly through any weather now
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions
That's why I sport the chinchilla to hurt their feelings

You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out at Vegas front row on all the fights and shit
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeal
'Cause half these rappers did blow like Derrick Forreal

If you cross the line, damn right, I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up

Kay keep tellin' me to speak about Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

My niggas don't dance
We just pull up the pants and
Do the Roc-away
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

I said my niggas don't dance

I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

And you know I Bacardi Lime it up ‘till you fall

Line it up ‘till you spoiled
And have them other chicks throwin’, vomit it up

But I ain’t used to movin’ slow like ketchup in a bottle

It was weird how we met, huh
She was wit her mom in Bank America
I'm wit my son cashin the check
So I asked outta respect (uh)
Would she like to explore the world up high
We can fly in my jet
Her reply was Yes, can I ask you somethin'?
I seen it in her eye, mama lookin like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (that ain't true) but it was something
About this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual; walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinkin smart (smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush
To touch, crush and be up, but baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up, we can talk
Conversate about political subjects whatever's thought
So I zoomed off, lookin by and my phone rang
It was her in the shower, (she said) she said I couldn't do without ya
Then I said. . .

The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playing ball
Here she comes wit her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showing off, tryna dunk tryna dribble break fast
Through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approched her wit a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys lookin at me sayin Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess wit it, please don't
Told her I'm going home she asked can she go too
I'm like Yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr, I took a shower jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong said I looked at her and said. . .

Cuz if you got an attitude I could treat you just like a hoe
Get to rollin wit me baby, hop in there's enough room

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby
They're all like ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fuckin' God, it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God, dude, you fuckin' rock
Please won't you please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my A Capella's
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
'Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Because I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

What the hell is wrong with that dressing room?
Cause our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, (uh-huh) it's simple but,
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back

Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
I really apologize for everything right now, if it's unclear at all, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
Y'know he had reconstru- I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man, this what I got to say right here, dawg (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

Kanye West:
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
Y'know what I'm saying? (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"" Haha (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
She can't be serious, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
(Right down to the wire, even through the fire)

Chaka Khan:

Through the fire, through whatever

Aha
It's dat real
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in dept
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if there part of your set
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yea, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin down
Why they sellin' niggaz CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my niggaz ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill Tupac n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why

(Chorus: Anthony Hamilton)
All that I been givin'
Is this thing that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why, oh why
Why they do me like that

(Jadakiss)
Why would niggaz push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggaz get degreez in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggaz lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggaz can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least

(Chorus)

(Jadakiss)
Uh, yea, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a why lie I need a beer sign
Why all the young niggaz is dyin'
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
Cause I got all my old ones
That's why

"Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray

Trying hard to reach out
But, when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here 
But something felt so wrong here 
So I'd pray 
I could break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change 
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get on board a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away
And break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
But, gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye, gotta
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But, I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change

Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party

Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)

Think I'ma be chasin the chickenhead, you're on somethin
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine

I betcha I'll have you doin what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good thangs don't last long

Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her friend
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name

(Verse 2: Chingy) 
Ma showed up like what's the hold up? 
Man know what get them wraps and roll up 
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin 
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping 
Niggaz knocking on the door drunk, actin silly 
The girl said can I be in yo video I'm like yeah!, oh really? 
Now she naked stripteasing, me I'm just cheesing 
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen 
Handled that, told OG, bring tha camera 
Then I thought about, no footage while I ram her 
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wildin 
Sharing the next room wit some girls lookin like they from an island 

(Chorus: Snoop + Chingy) 

(Verse 3: Ludacris) 
Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples 
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles 
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle 
Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles 
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles 
Just play a little D and I'll make ya mouth dribble 
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle 
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle 
Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles 
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle 
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels 
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle 
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo 
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple 
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again

"Okay!

Guess who's back (back, back)
Back again ( 'gain, 'gain)
Shady's back (back, back)
Tell a friend (friend, friend)

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor 
Alright stop - pajama time 

Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean wrap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation

Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
Having touched on everything but little boys

An' that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes

Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like tee pee for my bunghole and it's cool if you let one go

Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it
Give a little poot poot, it's okay (*fart*)
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
Get your chance, yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Just lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Go crazy (aah aah aah aah aah)
Oh baby (aah aah) Oh baby(aah aah) 

It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday 
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Every day's just a holiday

Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy 
Got the top down, let my hair blow 
I dunno where I'm goin', all I know
Is when I get there someone's gonna touch my body

'Scuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feel just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out...there

What's your name girl, what's your sign
Dr. Dre: Man, you must be up out your mind
Eminem: Dre, aah aah, beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Just lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Go crazy (aah aah aah aah aah)
Oh baby (aah aah) Oh baby(aah aah) 

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up 
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming (aah aah aah aah aah)

Well I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much 
I'm not guilty 
They said save it 
Boy we got you on tape
Yelling at an old lady, 
""Touch my body.""

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real intense no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 

A step back to reality 
Look it's B. Rabbit 
You signed me up to battle
I'm a grown man 
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba 
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Tubba Teletubbie

Fellas (What?) fellas (What?) 
Grab your left nut, make the right one jealous (What?) 
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls 
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls

Everyone report to the dance floor 
It's your chance for a little romance or 
Butt squeezin', it's the season 
Just go aah aah aah aah, it's so appeasing 

Now I'm gonna make you dance 
Get your chance 
Yeah boy shake that ass, 
Oops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl 
Girl, you know you're my world

Alright now lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Just lose it (aah aah aah aah aah)
Go crazy (aah aah aah aah aah)
Oh baby (aah aah) Oh baby(aah aah)

"My Dearest Son, it's almost June
I hope this letter Catches up with you and finds u well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol' in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said to much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared in our boots
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's womething funny
'bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best ya'll
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night Long,
Wonderin' where u might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring
Man on the Television said 
Something So I couldn't sleep
But iIll be alright, I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh 'cause she calls me honey
But they take it hard, 'cause I don't read the good parts
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me Drivin' on, waitn' on
Letters from home

Dear son, I know I ain't written
And sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen 
It occurs to me I might not have said it, so I'll say it now
Son, You make me proud

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs 'cause ain't nothin' 
Funny when a soldier cries, and I just wipe my eyes
I fold it up and put in my shirt get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on,

"'Jack and Diane' painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-ton short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

Well, I used to rock all night long
To 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back
(I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back
I go back","['contemporary country', 'country', 'country pop', 'singer/songwriter']",424.8,100,2004,4.800000000000001,98.21,358,47,"{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.9843000000000001}",I Go Back,1.3,Kenny Chesney,36,16
