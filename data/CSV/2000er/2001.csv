"I'm desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
I'm chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

Forgetting all I'm lacking
Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me

Now I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

There's nothing else to lose
There's nothing else to find
There's nothing in the world
That can change my mind

There is nothing else
There is nothing else
There is nothing else

I'm desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
I'm chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm living for the only thing I know
I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into

She listens like spring, and she talks like June, hey, hey

Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded

One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo

And head back to the Milky Way?

You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so, yo, I'm putting it down

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious then I guess it's true
But to tell the truth, I really never knew till I met you

See, I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, parole, the police files

So, yo
What's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down a few dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey, sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy

So sexy, almost evil
Talk about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead

You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So, butterfly, here is a song
And it's sealed with a kiss and a ""Thank you, miss.""

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So, come and dance with me, uh-huh, uh-huh

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady, come come, my lady
You're my butterfly sugar baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

When her parents went out
She'd phone, say 'hey boy, come on right around'
So I knock at the door, you were standing
With a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin, and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me 'bout Jacuzzi, sounded interesting, so we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone

I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?

Can you fill me in?

Whenever the coast was clear, and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say 'hey girl, come on right around'
So she knocked at the door, I was standing
With the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down bounce, bounce to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more?
Saying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in?
Wearing a jacket whose property? Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in?

All they seem to do, is be checking up on you, baby
Watching your every move
Think some day they might approve? Baby

You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that.. uuunnnh..

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em

Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!

Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures

I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush

We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks




Yeah...
Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
Niggaz actin like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that
so hopefully you won't have to go through that

Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight

Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great

On the small of my back, so I had to react

Like will it rain today

These twisted games we're playing

You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room

Is hope we don't take this ship down

Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you

Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here

Waiting for you

Longing for your kiss

And no questions

Years of bad decisions running down her face.

Watching the sun go down,

He was a slave to his job
And he couldn't be around.
So many things I want to say to him,
But I just placed a rose on his grave,
And I talked to the wind.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.

And everything that I hold dear in my life.

Got so much to be thankful for.

Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say
Boy,you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man,I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me
shootin' this real shit off like a gun
Mmmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I was iced up with a
Bentley and a house 
That's why
Fake-ass niggas get fake-ass digits
And fake-ass player get a real player hatin'em
""Honey Love"" goes platinum and y'all ass come 'round
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is goin' down

And now you hear my songs 
The radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears and what everybody is sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride with you 
How I used to hoop off in them to tournaments
With you
And how I used to club hop on weekends
With you
your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn...my condolences

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you 
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place 
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday 
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

Voices in my head
Be tellin' me to come to church
Say the lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt 
Dreaming of windows
Black-tinted like a hearse
But waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man 
And I try to keep it real with my homies, man
Want me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans

And now you hear my songs
The radio is playin'
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's sayin'
Boy I tell you folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride 
With you
How I used to street perform on Friday
With you and how I'd go to church on
Easter Sunday
With you
Instead of y'all throwin' them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you 
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place 
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smilin' down at me
Sayin' everything's OK
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday 
I wish, I wish, I wish

"I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' 
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's been 15 years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in teh mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive


I know the sun's still shinin' 
When I close my eyes

But why can't everyday be just this good

Sometimes it lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon, ah-ooh

Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu

The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time

There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

And El Dorado's I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow it's Showtime at the Apollo
Minus the Kiki Shepard what about a ho in a leopard-print
Teddy Pender-grass cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm

But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make

My nigga Bongo hooked it up Omar gone dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the honeycomb hideout

"He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
And then he lies awake and he wonders
""Why can't that be me?""

'Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things he'd rather not mention right now
Just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream

With a safe home, and a warm bed, on a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to hold on to
That's all she needs, yeah
