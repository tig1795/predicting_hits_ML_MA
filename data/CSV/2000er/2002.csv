"Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick inside without a sense of feelin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'

And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head scream
Are we having fun yet?
Yet? Yet? Yet? No, no
Yet? Yet? Yet? No, no

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you
And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

Baby, I don't know why
You're treating me so bad (treating me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me
And I was all you had

And though my heart is beatin' for ya
I can't stop crying
I don't know how
I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay

But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more

Baby, I don't know why
Ya wanna do me wrong (do me wrong)
See when I'm home, I'm all alone 
And you are always gone (always gone)

And boy, you know I really love you 
I can't deny 
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears 
After all these years

I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad 
What love will make you do 

All the things that we accept 
Be the things that we regret 
To all of my ladies (ladies)
Feel me, c'mon sing with me

See, when I get the strength to leave 
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you

So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to 'preciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)

But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me?
Leave me and desert me 
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up

Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags

"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there, oh
Who can bring me back to you

If I could then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

My life and love my still go on

I'll stay with you for all of time

"(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

It doesn't even matter how hard you try

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (Far)

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel

Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits

Till someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves 
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you ask for me?
Well I'm back - na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in it 

Up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting

""Testing, attention please""

I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene (hey)

Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (hey)

But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

"Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'

Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama? Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it, imma expose it
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't owe him a second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today

What I did was stupid, no doubt, it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd have killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time

I said, I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen, 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen

Bitchin', that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Münchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick, when I wasn't
Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony

And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself, that you was a mom

But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what: I am dead - dead to you as can be!

Hold up, wait up, shorty

To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting

He goes home, and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water

Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

Cause nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell ya before
About chasin' those waterfalls
Chasin' waterfalls
Yeah

Cause nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, what did we tell ya before 
About chasin' those waterfalls

Yeah

Yeah, baby
Sometimes the Rule don't mind the rain
It kinda feels like I'm drownin' in the Lord's pain
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile, and give me a reason to keep on believin'
That everything ain't misleadin'
And I kiss the clouds on them rainy days
And smile for you, when the skies are gray
Babe, cause I'm a tear drop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord, would you shower my pain
Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel, that can't soar, can't fly
And I mastered it, Lord knows why

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

I feel like an angel
With my broken wings
So I can soar again
Lord, let me in
Baby, through all the passion, the pain, and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin', yeah

Makin' clothes for all of those 
That spread the love
And for those who can't take it
Stand up
Baby, we gonna make it
In the words of Marvin Gaye
War is not the answer

Nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, didn't we tell ya before
About chasin' those waterfalls
Chasin' waterfalls

Yeah

Nobody loves the rain

Can't stand it
But it always seems to fall

Baby, handle it
Baby, what did we tell ya before 
About chasin' those waterfalls

Yeah

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun come out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

Smile, smile, smile, smile
Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile
Til the sun shines
Just smile for me
Just smile for me, just smile at me
Know in your heart, that we are free
Free to believe, whatever we feel
So feel somethin' real, baby

(Lil' Mo) If I can go, with you
(Angie M) Yo, yo, uh

(Verse 1: Angie Martinez)
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

(Chorus: Lil' Mo)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Verse 2: Sacario)
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say

If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

(Bridge: Lil' Mo)
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

(Martinez Angie)
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

(Sacario)
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

(Angie+S)
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

(Sacario)
Go 'head

(Martinez Angie)
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

(Sacario)
Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

(Martinez Angie)
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

(Sacario)
And the shop's there?

(Martinez Angie)
If they don't got em, they don't make em

((Sacario:) True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever
from the neck - see ain't nuttin changed, hit the stage
Set a date sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin hair with stylin gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit fuck, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for dem niggaz workin at the airport
who got laid off, I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole, whole, world, world

Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine

I catch a beat runnin like Randy Moss
Ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin my stone, gatherin no moss
Mami I'm comin I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on fourth fourth
Make that track a fourth fouth
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
with my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast just won't stop

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismal
Need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches
like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list
I know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing God's willing all things that are do able
The only liable limitation is to self

This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrased to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self destruct


Baby smile today
Cuz I been on that journey always
I'm gon' luv u better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' luv u better


When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know




Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt u? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together


It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise

He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me,
But I've been sober three years now

Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls

Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt saying ""I'm a grandpa""
And being right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up

Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, til' the transom got rotten

My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and 
I would press that clutch 
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine

Go to the bank and the hardware store,
Put a new lock on the cellar door.
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done,
But when the sun is settled, there's still more than a few things left
I haven't got to yet.

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer, 
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that i make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Wouldn't change the course of fate,
Cuttin' the grass just had to wait
Cause i've got more important things
Like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave

Put an extra five in the plate at church,
Call up my folks just to chat,

Stay up late, and over sleep
Show her what she means to me

I won't let you down baby  
If you give me that chance to be your man 
Here baby, hold my jacket  
And then...  

Maybe we'll fly the night away   
(I just want to love you baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Girl  
Maybe we'll fly the night away  
(I just wanna love ya baby)  
Girl....

(Pusha T)  
Ma' whatcha wanna do?  
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two  
Or me and you put on a stage show  
And the mall kids, that's how to change low  
Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow'  
Point to me I say 'Yea, it's the same dough'  
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night  

(Malice)  
Do a robbery, you deservin' the best  
Take a few shots  
Let it burn in your chest  
We could ride down  
Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck  
Funny how a few words turn into sex 
(I just love your...brain...)  
Play number three, Joint called 'Brain' 
Ma, take a hint
Make a swerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away 
(I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Girl..  
Maybe we'll fly the night away 
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl...)  

Ain't nobody love you like I love ya 
(Can't love ya like I do)  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Makes me trust ya like I do, hey)  
Late at night I talk to you (hey) 
You will know the difference when I...

(Break it down)  

You know  
I used to dream about this when I was a little boy  
I never thought it would end up this way 
Drums... (hey)

It's kinda special right, yeah  
You know, if you think about it  
Sometimes people are just destined  
Destined to do what they do  
And that's what it is

"He was a 6 foot stallion say the storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpatatin' everytime he came near
He had a spankin new Range sport a tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his hair was corn-rowed
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Cuz I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Me and my crew started groovin made our way to the floor
It's time activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me I felt fingertips
On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this thug my man that I can tell you, for sure

I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Cuz I do, wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
with an iced out playah ballin out of control

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Now watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin all the pappi's want me but all I want is you

(I do)
