"Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand, someone who understands
And when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say ""I'll show you""

Say you, say me
Say it for always, oh
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

So you think you know the answers, oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing, oh yes
Believe in who you are
You are a shining star

Say you, say me
Say it for always, aw
That's the way it should be

Say you, say me
Say it together
Naturally

Say it together

"So many times said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you

On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married

On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself

No one said it was easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believed in love (in love)
Now here I stand
I wonder why, ooh

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
(On my own) This wasn't how it was supposed to end
(On my own) I wish that we could do it all again

So many times I know I should have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you

On my own, I've got to find where I belong again

I've got to learn how to be strong again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone

I've got to find out what was mine again
My heart is saying that it's my time again
And I have faith that I will shine again

The victory is yours alone

There's something out there

In dreams never touch the earth

In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss (prince hides his face)
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be

Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say, ""Look who's in the big town""
But my bed is in a small town

"I saw you standing and I felt your rage
Like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl, I know what to believe 

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie 

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up, ooh
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up 

In your dream, it's overcast
Rain comes down, moving your way fast
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

You turn a corner and you see a door
Walk on through, throw yourself on the floor
Oh, when you're looking up, it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with movie star eyes

You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
And I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie 

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
