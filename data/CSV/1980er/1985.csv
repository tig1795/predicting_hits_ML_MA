"I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin, hey!
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Woah, woah
Ahh, woah

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours till the end of time

Yeah, you make me feel I've nothin' to hide

Like a virgin, hey!
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me

"I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I'd better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Ohhh

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders

In a show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies ‚Äì doesn't seem a minute

All changed, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings

Or this place!

Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the flair
That ya got from chasin'
All those east coast dares
And I've seen it before
It happens time and again
All cut up inside
Yet you're caught in a spin

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Saw you dancin' out at Madame Wong Two's
You did the same two steps
That I taught you back in June
Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Caf√©
Did you get your fill
Did you think you had to pay

Still I noticed your urgency 
And recognized the pain
And I'm sure it's the same
You feel again and again
And I wish I could get us
That second chance
But you're having too much fun 
With your sudden romance

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us 
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look 
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Oh' take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us 
Guess I'll leave it up to you
Saw you walking out on Sentimental Street
What'cha doin' out there
Who you tryin' to be
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us
Guess I'll leave it up to you",['hard rock'],428.4,99,1985,4.0,91.78,336,60,"{'neg': 0.051000000000000004, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.14100000000000001, 'compound': 0.9876}",Sentimental Street,1.7000000000000002,Night Ranger,25,24
"My sugar walls
My sugar walls

Where I came from
There's a place called Heaven
That's the place where
All the good children go

The houses are of silver
The streets are gold
But there's more
Where you come from
My sugar walls

My sugar walls, ooh
My sugar walls

Blood races to your private spots
Lets me know there's a fire
You can't fight passion
When passion is hot
Temperatures rise
Inside my sugar walls

Lemme take you somewhere
You've never been
I can show you things
You've never seen

I can make you never
Wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night
Inside my sugar walls

Take advantage, it's all right

I feel so alive
When I'm with you
Come and feel my presence
It's raining tonight

Heaven on Earth
Inside my sugar walls

Let me take you somewhere
You've never been
I can show you things
You've never seen

I can make you never
Wanna fall in love again
Come spend the night
Inside my sugar walls

I can tell you want me
(My sugar walls)
It's impossible to hide
Your body's on fire, admit it
Come inside (my sugar walls)

Ahhh (my sugar walls) ooh
Come inside (my sugar walls)
My sugar walls

(My sugar walls)
Come spend the night
Inside my sugar walls

(My sugar walls)
