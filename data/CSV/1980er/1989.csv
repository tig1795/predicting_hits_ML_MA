"When you called me up this morning
Told me 'bout the new love you found
I said: ""I'm happy for you
I'm really happy for you""

Found someone else
I guess I won't be coming 'round
I guess it's over, baby
It's really over, baby, ohoho

And from what you said
I know you've gotten over me
It'll never be the way it used to be

So if it's gotta be this way
Don't worry, baby I can take the news okay

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

And if we meet on the street someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

When we both agreed as lovers
We were better off as friends
That's how it had to be
Yeah, that's how it had to be

I tell you I'm fine
But sometimes I just pretend
Wish you were holding me
Wish you were still holding me, ohoho

I just never thought
That I would be replaced so soon
I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you

I know I wanted to be free
Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be

But if you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

If we meet on the street someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

And if we meet on the street someday
And I don't know what to say
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

If you see me walking by
And the tears are in my eyes
Look away, baby, look away

Don't look at me
I don't want you to see me this way

"We both lie silently still in the dead of the night

Was it something I said or something I did

Though I tried, but I guess that's why they say

Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn, yeah it does

I listen to our favorite song, playin' on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow

I guess every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love
We both made our separate ways

And now I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

Workin' all week nine to five for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar"" 
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing 

Wild thing 
Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype 
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing 
She wanna do the wild thing
Please baby baby please

Wild thing

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say 
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing 
I need fifty dollars to make you holler 
I get paid to do the wild thing""

With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
At the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Gigolo, huh, sukka?
Gigolo, gigolo, huh, sukka?

Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?

We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Get funky
Yeah Timmy
Tell it like it is
Check out this DJ

So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shows worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place

Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in every way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me

Smokin'. Not cokin'. Get funky sax.
Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch.
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance.
Looking good when it comes to the crunch

Food is served and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance

Sits down next to you and starts talkin'

Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

Could care less about the five you're blowin'

Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are

Looking for a man makes them opportunistic

So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm you got the speed

"I'm thinking

Cold coolin' at a bar, and I'm lookin' for some action
But like Mick Jagger said, ""I can't get no satisfaction""
The girls are all around, but none of them want to get with me
My threds are fresh and I'm looking def
Yo, what's up with L-O-C?
The girls I sawjokin' at the other end of the bar
Havin' drinks with some no-name chump
When they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?""
He said, ""Funky Cold Medina""

Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass
And the girls will come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog, when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me
And did the Wild Thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me
Before he was much, much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house
For the Funky cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin'? I got every dog in my neighborhood
Breakin' down my door, I got Spuds McKenzie, Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink, "" I said OK, I'd go get it
Then a couple of sips, she sold licked her lips
And I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess
Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around
With in Oscar Meyer weiner
You must be sure that your girl is pure
For the Funky Cold Medina
You know, ain't no playin' with a man
This is the 80's and I'm down with the ladies, ya know?

Break it down

Back in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection
I took a shot as a conteatant on the Love Connection
The audience voted and you lnow they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin' soon what I'll be gettin'
Instead she started talkin' about plans for a weddin'
Said wait, slow down, love, not so fast, says ""I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by

But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales

Still untouched by men

And the tall grass waves in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

O beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king

Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales

Since Daddy had to lie

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin

And let your hair spill all around me

But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us

I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye

Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
This is the end
This is the end of the innocence
