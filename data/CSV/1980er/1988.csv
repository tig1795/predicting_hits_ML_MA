"Well, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door

'Cause I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues

Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more

Yes, I gotta have faith
Mm, I gotta have faith
Because I've gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I'll just have to wait
Because I got to have faith

I gotta have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith

Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor (I've just got to have faith)
Oh, oh baby, I've reconsidered my foolish notion

"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Without your love, a dog without a bone

And pain was the price you paid

I wanna ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I've got nothing to prove

You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us out of here
Been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
Live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young, to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

Say, remember when we were driving, driving in your car?
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
We go cruising entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
Now I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Say, remember when we were driving, driving in your car?
Speeds so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar 
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans and I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

Say, remember when we were driving, driving in your car?

"Don't you know 
So many things, they come and go 
Like your words that once rang true 
Just like the love I thought I found in you 

And I remember the thunder 
Talking 'bout the fire in your eyes 
But you walked away when I needed you most 
Now maybe baby, maybe baby 

I found someone 
To take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness 
I've been feelin' since you've been gone 
Since you've been gone 

Dry your eyes 
I never could bear to see you cry 
Someday your love will shine through 
And show you the feelings that you never really knew 

But baby don't you loose that thunder 
Talking 'bout the fire in your eyes 
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe 
That maybe baby, maybe baby 

I found someone 
To take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness 
I've been feelin' since you've been gone 
Since you've been gone 

Too long on the border line 
Wondering if your love was really mine 
But you left me with open eyes 
And when I realized 

Baby 
I found someone 
To take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness 
I've been feelin' since you've been gone

To take away the heartache 
To take away the loneliness

For a thousand years

I'd make wine from your tears

"So wild, standing there, with her hands in her hair
I can't help remember just where she touched me
There's still no face here in her place
So cool, she was like jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet, then she just flew away
Now she can't be that warm with the wind in her arms

Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be

Love songs fill the night, but they don't tell it all
Not how lovers cry, just like they're dying
Her cries hang there, in time, somewhere
Someday, some good wind may blow her back to me
Some night I may hear her like she used to be
No it can't be that warm with the wind in her arms

But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night

Is it true 
Your telling me to trust 
What should I believe

You tell me that you're serious

A message revealed in your eyes 
You know I can't wait 
To know your passion 
It's not to late 
So take some action 
Can you say that when you're through 
I'll know what love is all about 
Well, baby I've been patient, now 
I'm ready to find out
