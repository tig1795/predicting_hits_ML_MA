"I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like
Making good conversation

You know what I mean
I took you to an intimate restaurant
Then to a suggestive movie

Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk

I've been patient, I've been good
Tried to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard this holdin' back
You know what I mean

I'm sure you'll understand my point of view
We know each other mentally
You gotta know that you're bringin' out

"Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive       

So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft, fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that neglig√©e
Is really just too much

He earned his love through discipline, a thund'ring, velvet hand.

You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see that you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you

"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ......
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do .....
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City

"I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

Through the years
You've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found
I've found with you
Through the years
I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you
Through the years

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through the years
Through all the good and bad
I know how much we had
I've always been so glad
To be with you
Through the years
It's better every day
You've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay
I'll stay with you
Through the years

Through the years
When everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belonged
Right here with you
Through the years
I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out
I've learned what life's about
By loving you
Through the years

Through the years
You've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found
I've found with you
Through the years
It's better every day
You've kissed my tears away

I'll stay with you

"Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
I said to my friend, baby, nothing else mattered

He was no more than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken-hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him
All alone on the edge of
Seventeen

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, well, the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir
And a melody
And nothing else mattered

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colors
But the sea does not change
So with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age-old desire to please
On the edge of seventeen
Ooh

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, then suddenly
There was no one left standing in the hall
Yeah, yeah, in a flood of tears that
No one really ever heard fall at all
Well, I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
A-not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a night bird
Singing ""Come away"" (Come away)

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I hear you in the morning
And I hear you at nightfall
And sometime to be near you 
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
I'm a few years older than you
(I'm a few years older than you) My love

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh","['american', 'pop', 'rock']",581.4,100,1982,4.4,99.23,479,73,"{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.209, 'compound': 0.9979}",Edge Of Seventeen,0.9,Stevie Nicks,34,41
