"Oh well bless my soul

My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug

And what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Hmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm

My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine

We passed the time away
Writing love letters in the sand

How you laughed when I cried
Each time I saw the tide
Take our love letters from the sand

You made a vow that you would ever be true

Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were goin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jokey folks they had a jamboree;
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano

So I can hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
