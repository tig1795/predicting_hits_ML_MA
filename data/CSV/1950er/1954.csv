"Wanted
Someone who kissed me
And held me closely
Then stole my heart

Wanted
Someone I trusted
Who gave no warning
We'd ever part

She was last seen
Hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing
Of the danger in her charms

A jury
May find her guilty
But I'd forgive her
If I could see

A signed confession
That she's repented
And really wanted
No one but me

And held me closely
Then stole my heart

But I'd forgive her

"Lately when I'm in my room
All by myself
In the solitary gloom
I call to myself

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you
You use to be too wise

Hey there
You on that high flyin' cloud
Though he won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday he'll come to you

Better forget him
Him with his nose in the air
He has you dancin' on a string
Break it and he won't care

Won't you take this advice I hand you like a mother
Or are you not seein' things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all goin' in one ear and out the other

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
(Are you talking to me?)
Love never made a fool of you

"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore

"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you
If you're young at heart

For it's hard you will find
To be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart

You can go to extremes
With impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams
Fall apart at the seams

And life gets more exciting
with each passing day
And love is either in your heart
Or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth
To be young at heart

For as rich as you are
It's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start
If you are among the very
Young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Think of all you'll derive
Out of being alive

And here is the best part
You've had a head start

Young at heart...","['big band', 'chrismas', 'christmas', 'columbia', 'easy listening soundtracks and musicals', 'garland', 'jazz', 'pop', 'swing', 'swing; jazz; big band; christmas', 'vocal']",198.0,11,1954,4.0,108.7,173,34,"{'neg': 0.007, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.20600000000000002, 'compound': 0.9903000000000001}",Young At Heart,-0.7000000000000001,Frank Sinatra,11,15
"This ole house once knew his children
This ole house once knew his wife
This ole house was home and comfort
As they fought the storms of life

This old house once rang with laughter
This old house heard many shouts
Now he trembles in the darkness
When the lightnin' walks about

This ole house lets in the cold

But he feel no fear nor pain
'Cause he see an angel peekin'
Through a broken windowpane

This ole house is afraid of storms

"If you're a guy that's had a gal in each and every port
And you've forgot the rules of love that life has always taught
And if you broke as many hearts as ripples in a stream
Well, brother, here's the only way that you can be redeemed

Cross over the bridge, cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother, cross over the bridge

If you have built a boat to take you to the greener side
And if that boat is built of ev'ry lie you ever lied
You'll never reach the Promised Land of love, I guarantee
'cause lies cannot hold water and you'll sink into the sea

Cross over the bridge, cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother, cross over the bridge

I know it isn't easy to resist temptation's call
But think of how your broken heart will hurt you when you fall
'cause some day you will find that you are hopelessly in love
And she'll belong to someone else as sure as stars above

Cross over the bridge, cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother, cross over the bridge

Cross over the bridge

"(In Napoli where love is king
When boy meets girl here's what they say)

When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore

That's amore
