"if you loved me half as much as i love you
you wouldnt worry me half as much as you do
you're nice to me when theres no one else around
you only build me up to let me down
if you missed me half as much as i miss you
you wouldnt stay away half as much as you do
i know that i would never be this blue
if you only loved me half as much as i love you

(musical interlude)

you're nice to me when theres no one else around
you only build me up to let me down

you wouldnt stay away half as much as you do

"I went to your wedding
Although I was dreading
The thought of losing you

The organ was playing
My poor heart kept saying
""Your dreams, your dreams are through""

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness

I uttered a sigh
Whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness

I uttered a sigh
Then whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Oh, your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you","['country', 'pop']",157.5,8,1952,3.6,92.8,119,27,"{'neg': 0.249, 'neu': 0.5740000000000001, 'pos': 0.177, 'compound': -0.91}",I Went To Your Wedding,1.3,Patti Page,16,17

Here in my heart I just yearn for you only
Here in my arms I long to hold you
Hold you so near, ever close to my heart

Surely you know I need your love so badly
Here is my heart, my life and my all, dear
Please be mine and stay here in my heart

"I walked down the street like a good girl should
He followed me down the street like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

I walked to my house like a good girl should
He followed me to my house like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be 
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

I never saw the boy before, so nothing could be sillier
At closer range his face was strange but his manner was familar

So I walked up the stairs like a good girl should
He followed me up the stairs like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

So I walked to my door like a good girl should
He stopped at my door like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

He asked me for a good night kiss
I said it's still good day
I would have told him more except
His lips got in the way

So I talked to my ma like a good girl should
And ma talked to pa like I knew she would
And they all agreed on the married life for me
A guy is a guy wherever ever he may be

So I walked down the aisle like a good girl should 
He followed me down the aisle like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be 
So now youv'e heard the story of what someone did to me.

That's what he did to me","['american', 'big band', 'easy listening soundtracks and musicals', 'pop']",362.7,17,1952,6.0,95.17,314,31,"{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.20600000000000002, 'compound': 0.9958}",A Guy Is A Guy,2.5,Doris Day,14,18
"Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
On this, our wedding day
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Wait; wait alone
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
For I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love an' duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearing high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life for his an'
I'm not afraid of death but, oh, what shall I do
If you leave me? 

Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Although you're grievin', don't think of leavin'
Now that I need you by my side
