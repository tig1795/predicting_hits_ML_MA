Way back up in the woods among the evergreens

Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode

But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!

Go Johnny go!
Go

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineer would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go

His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight""

"Well, you ask me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will some day
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll get along
I guess I will some way
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on, 
Then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man 
And have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will every day
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

You ask me if I'll find another
I don't know, I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

"Someday I'm goin' to write
The story of my life!
I'll tell about the night we met
And how my heart can't forget
The way you smiled at me!

I want the world to know
The story of my life –
The moment when your lips met mine
And that first exciting time
I held you close to me!

The sorrow in our love was breakin' up
The mem'ry of a broken heart –
But later on, the joy of makin' up
Never never more to part!

There's one thing left to do
Before my story's through
I've got to take you for my wife –
So the story of my life
Can start and end with you!
