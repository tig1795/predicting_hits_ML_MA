"Unchain me, unchain me
Unchain me, unchain me
Unchain me

Unchain me, unchain me
Unchain me, unchain me

Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me",['film composer'],76.5,5,1955,4.0,91.78,61,12,"{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.669, 'pos': 0.298, 'compound': 0.969}",Unchained Melody,1.7000000000000002,Les Baxter,5,5
"You made me cry 
When you said goodbye

You' re the one to blame 

You broke my heart

"Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number-nine coal
And the straw boss said, ""Well bless my soul!""

You load sixteen tons, whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebreak by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons, whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store","['death by liver failure', 'spiritual']",322.2,13,1955,5.2,97.2,263,32,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': -0.6174000000000001}",Sixteen Tons,1.7000000000000002,Tennessee Ernie Ford,24,18
"The tables are empty - the dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song - it's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning - just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson - in learnin' the blues

The cigarettes you light - one after another
Won't help you forget her - and the way that you love her
You're only burning - a torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track - for learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you - constantly
When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep - the whole night you're crying
You just can't forget her - soon you even stop trying
You'll walk the floor - and wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break - you're learnin' the (those) blues","['big band', 'chrismas', 'christmas', 'columbia', 'easy listening soundtracks and musicals', 'garland', 'jazz', 'pop', 'swing', 'swing; jazz; big band; christmas', 'vocal']",167.4,14,1955,5.6,96.18,139,14,"{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.5158}",Learnin' The Blues,2.1,Frank Sinatra,9,2

"A blossom fell from off a tree
It settled softly on the lips you turned to me
The gypsies say and I know why
""A falling blossom only touches lips that lie.""

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

"Born on a mountain in Tennessee
Greenest state in the land of the free
Raised in the woods so's he knew every tree
He killed him a b'ar when he was only three

Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

Fought single-handed thru the Injun war
'Till the Creeks was whipped and the peace was in store
And while he was a'handlin' this risky chore
Made hisself a legend forever more

Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear

When he lost his love, his grief was gall
In his heart, he wanted to leave it all
And lose hisself in the forest tall
But he answered, instead, his country's call

Davy, Davy Crockett, the choice of the whole frontier

He went off to Congress and served a spell
Fixin' up the government and laws as well
Took over Washington, so I hear tell
And patched up a crack in the Liberty Bell

Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear

When he came home, his politickin' done
Why, the big western march had just begun
So he packed his gear and his trusty gun
And lit out a'grinnin' to follow the sun

Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer

His land is the biggest, his land is the best
From grassy plaines to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all and meetin' the test
And a'follern' his legend right into the west

"Only you can make all this world seem right
Only you can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone
Can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love for only you

Only you can make all this change in me
For it's true, you are my destiny
When you hold my hand
I understand the magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you
