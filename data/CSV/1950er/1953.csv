"No other love have I
Only my love for you! 
Only the dream we knew
No other love! 

Watching the night go by
Wishing that you could be 
Watching the night with me
Into the night I cry! 

Hurry home
Come home to me! 
Set me free
Free from doubt
And free from longing! 

Into your arms I'll fly
Locked in your arms I'll stay
Waiting to hear you say
No other love have I
No other love! 

(Into the night I cry!) 

Hurry home
Come home to me! 
Set me free
Free from doubt
And free from longing! 

Into your arms I'll fly
Locked in your arms I'll stay
Waiting to hear you say
No other love have I! 
No other love! 
(No other love!) 
No other love!","['adult contemporary', 'american', 'big band', 'classic pop and rock', 'country', 'easy listening', 'jazz', 'latin', 'pop', 'rock', 'rock and roll', 'swing']",153.9,8,1953,3.6,101.26,129,29,"{'neg': 0.14, 'neu': 0.54, 'pos': 0.319, 'compound': 0.9911000000000001}",No Other Love,0.1,Perry Como,9,16

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night
In daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't keep your heart from me
For someday I'll return
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love

Too many nights (Too many nights)
Too many stars (Too many stars)
Too many moons could change your mind

"I believe for every drop of rain that falls 
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray 
Some one will come to show the way
I believe,  I believe

I believe above the storm the smallest prayer 
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere 
Hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry 
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
I believe, I believe

I believe the lord in heaven  he is my guide 
My sins he'll hide 
I believe on calvary that jesus died 
That pierced side 
I believe in death we'll part to rise again
And meet in heaven to that loud amen
Then I know why, I believe.",['death by heart failure'],179.1,10,1953,4.4,90.77,133,21,"{'neg': 0.152, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.836}",I Believe,2.1,Frankie Laine,12,1
"First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, you are love
Really mine in the rain

In the dark, in the sun
Oh, like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web of your arms",['production music'],104.4,12,1953,4.0,100.24,89,15,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.20700000000000002, 'compound': 0.9618000000000001}",Ebb Tide,0.5,Frank Chacksfield,5,2
"Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend
Remember anyone can dream
And nothing's as bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got could be a lot if you pretend
You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes she'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine it can be yours my friend

"I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty
I'd be a millionaire

My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything

So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure that I'm hopin' for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine ever more

Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you

Must I forever be a beggar

"Say the sun will never shine again, 
And say the rose that blooms will never bloom again, 
But come what may I know I must have you again, 
My darling, say you're mine again! 

Say that spring will never come again, 
And say the chapel bells will never ring again, 
No matter what will be I must be yours again, 
So darling, say you're mine again! 

If I were to lose all the world and it's treasures, 


Who cares, let it be as it may, 
As long as I have you beside me, 
I'll always be happy that way! 

Say I'll never see the rain again, 
And say I'll never hear a sweet refrain again, 
And say that I was wrong and I'm to blame again, 
But darling, say you're mine again!

"Tell me story, tell me story
Tell me story, remember what you said
You promised me you said you would
You got to give in, so I'll be good
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Oh, worry, worry, weary ends my day
Comes the time to go home without my raise in pay
Home by the fire where a man can just relax
Sippers there by the chair, not a worry, not a care
Along comes Junior swinging his little axe

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
Tell me about the birds and bees
How do you make a chicken sneeze?
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Came home so late one evening last July
Played a little poker the time had passed me by
Shoes in my hand and my darlin' wife in bed
Up the stairs sayin' a prayer
Then a voice comes through the air

Hi you there, daddy
Remember what you said

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
Tell me how your eye got black
Because the doorway hit you back
Tell me a story then I'll go to bed

Once upon a time I remember long ago
Don't go back in history, your memory's kinda slow
Stop your noisy talkin' until I finish with my tale

Once upon a, upon a what
Upon your back, you'll get a swat
Tell me about the fish you caught
That's was bigger than a whale

Tell me a story, tell me a story
Tell me a story, remember what you said
You promised me, you said you would
You gotta give in, so I'll be good

Here's a tale you'll never forget
(Tap, tap, tap)
Ouch, my tails all red
And now get up to bed
Ha, ha come on daddy, tell me a story, hee, hee",['death by heart failure'],388.8,23,1953,4.800000000000001,98.21,325,43,"{'neg': 0.059000000000000004, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.08700000000000001, 'compound': 0.8798}",Tell Me A Story,1.3,Frankie Laine,31,14
"C'est si bon
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good

C'est si bon
So I say to you
Like the French people do
Because it's oh, so good

Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
C'est si bon

Nothing else can replace
Just your slyest embrace
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, my darling...
