"They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all","['american', 'death by lung cancer', 'easy listening soundtracks and musicals', 'jazz', 'jump blues', 'pop', 'swing', 'usa', 'vocal jazz']",100.8,1,1951,4.800000000000001,106.67,92,13,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.133, 'compound': 0.937}",Too Young,0.1,Nat King Cole,4,5

"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire with every sweet desire

Be my love and with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all that I need to seal my fate
And, hand-in-hand, we'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you for me, eternally
If you will be my love

"I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory

To wake up in the morning to the mockin' bird's trill

You're welcome as the flowers on Mockin'bird Hill

And kisses the roses 'round my windowsill
Then my heart fills with gladness when I hear the trill
Of those birds in the treetops on Mockin'bird Hill

And survey all my kingdom while everything's still
Only me and the sky and an old whippoorwill

What is your future, now we have to part?
Standing on the jetty as the steamer moves away
Flower of Malaya, I cannot stay

Make way, oh, make way for my Eastern Rose
Men crowd in dozens everywhere she goes
In her rickshaw on the street or in a cabaret

All my life I shall remember
Oriental music and you in my arms
Perfumed flowers in your tresses
Lotus-scented breezes and swaying palms

Rose, Rose, I love you with your almond eyes
Fragrant and slender 'neath tropical skies
I must cross the seas again and never see you more
Way back to my home on a distant shore

Kiss me farewell now, there's nothin' to say

"I hear singing and there's no one there, 
I smell blossoms and the trees are bare, 
All day long I seem to walk on air, 
I wonder why, I wonder why ? 

I keep tossing in my sleep at night, 
And what's more I've lost my appetite, 
Stars that used to twinkle in the skies, 
Are twinkling in my eyes, 
I wonder why ? 

You don't need analyzin' 
It is not so surpisin' 
That you feel very strange but nice! 
Your heart goes pitter patter 
I know just what's the matter 
Because I've been there once or twice! 

Put your head on my shoulder 
You need someone who's older 
A rub-down with a velvet glove! 
There is nothing you can take 
To relieve that pleasant ache 
You're not sick, you're just in love! 

 

Now you know why! 
Now I know why!
