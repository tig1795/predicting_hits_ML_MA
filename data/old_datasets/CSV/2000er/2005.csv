"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, ooh, ooh, sweet love, yeah

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go

I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself

I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself

'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice

Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here 'cause, baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio saying to me,
""If you think you're lonely now.""

Wait a minute, this is too deep 
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface

I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying

Trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

When you left I lost a part of me 
It's still so hard to believe 
Come back baby, please 
'Cause we belong together

Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? 
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better

With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm

Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm

And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

I get told to flip dough to get more, fo sho'
Get my drink on then get on the dance floor
Look homie I don't dance all I do is this
It's the same 2-step with a little' twist
Listen pimpin' I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention boy, I teach how to do this shit
You mix a lil' criss with a little Don Perignon
And a little' Hennessy, you know we 'finna carry on
Hollerin' at this bitch in da club tryin' to get right
we gonna be up in this bitch 'til we break daylight

"50 Cent:
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

The Game:
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop

From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

The Game:
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?
I love you ma

I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now switch

Hey switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn around, now switch
Turn it over and hit it

Uh uh uh
I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like, ""Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody""
But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on
Switch

Hey switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn around, now switch
Turn it over and hit it

Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh
What you too cute to dance, or you scared

It ain't really that hard to do and
I aint trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right hear waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo

Hey, hey

That's what I'm talking 'bout, do that thing mama

I ain't ever had nobody show me all the things

That you done showed me

In a special way I feel when you hold me

We gon' always be together baby

That is what you told and

I believe it cause I ain't never had

Nobody do me like you





Now I done been with different kind of girls

So like I done seen them all

But ain't none of them at all (like you)

And I done seen the best of the best

Baby, still I ain't impressed cause

Ain't none of them at all (like you)

If you know how I feel when I chill

Look, if I'm seen with a girl

Then she gotta be just (like you)

And baby thats the way I feel

And I ain't got no choice

But for me to keep it real

Cause when we first got together

Starting hanging out you was skeptical at first

Had to figure out if

I was the kind of guy that

Would try to dog you out but

I ain't that kind of guy you try to make me out

You found out when you turned to my baby

I showed them other brothers

How to treat a lady

I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes

And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady

Cause baby you know









And everytime I think about you I smile

When you ride, when you call, when you come around

Your love is amazing to me

I can't wait till I see you (I wanna be with you again)

And everytime your out on the road (I'll make a trip)

And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)

That I'm your main chick

Who got that game chick

One in the same chick

The one you can hang with









Ok we hit the mall, pop tags

Spend a few G's (Cheesin')

Hit the runway to a new season

It ain't nothing

Spoil the one I care for

Feel like I ain't doin' enough

That's when I shape off

I give you this, give you that

What chu need love

You know I got it

Holla at me if you need love

In affection cause I'll be your protection

Kind of hard job but I'll do till perfection

And you can tell that I ain't tryin' to let you go

I get with you when I can

So thats how I let you know

And you be trippin' cause sometimes I gotta go

But chu the first one

I hollared to right after my show

Hey now I was trippin' in a sense

I was tense but my body's lose around you

But I'ma do without you

I gotta get it together, say whateva

Since I met you my life seems so better

Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it

It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh God I, I

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it

It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry

'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be 
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree 
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying

'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom

Was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart

Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me

But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV 
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now

Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why

I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile

Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
Cuz this is how I'm livin and yall women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
It's the power of the p-u-s-s-y
Got a lotta niggaz wonderin it ain't just i
Gotta keep ya cash comin and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got

Leaning on the mother tree, I
Said to myself we all lost touch

And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough

It puts over me

Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down, upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your
Strength

Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the Earth
The Sun was just yellow energy

There is a living promise land
And even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind, and cover me
Bringing back, more than a memory

You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over, the sides...

Well, it's a long way from Star,Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Whoo!

Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world

Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy

Hope all is well, kiss the plantiff and the wifey

Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell them holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later until these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
