"Where is the moment when needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
Tell me your blue skies fade to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You're standing in line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with a coffee to go
Tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down 
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song 
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile 
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down
And you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Oh, a holiday

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well all that strong
And I'm not wrong, yeah

So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song
Just to turn it around

You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work on a smile
And you go for a ride

You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

You had a bad day

You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light

You might be the type if I play my cards right

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kind of cute

Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'mma lay mine's down

I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'mma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health

I want you on my team
So does everybody else

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

(Bring that on?) You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things

I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Will have a nigga locked up in the maximum

I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart

Searching for the right,

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside

I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why

I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long

Where I'm about to go

How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh oh oh
Oh God I, I

I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it

Every memory of walking out the front door

It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

It's hard to say it

Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it

I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever

But we both know
Nothing comes close to

What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny

Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly

Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy

I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

There she goes shakin’ that ass on the flow
Bumpin’ and grindin’ that pole
The way she's grindin’ that pole
I think I’m losing control.

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don’t forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up

Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin’ still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Showin’ I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit.

Nate Dogg
2 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn’t believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat

3 to the 1 from the 1 to the 3
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey

I’ve been to the muthafuckin’ mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen ’em drop
If I ain’t got a weapon I’m a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo’ ass I’m gon’ continue to rock

Get ya ass off the wall with your 2 left feet
It’s real easy just follow the beat
Don’t let that fly girl pass you by
Look real close ’cause strobe lights lie.

We about to have a party
Let’s get it started 
Go ahead shake your butt
I’m lookin’ for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin’ baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are ’bout it, ’bout it
I’m lookin’ for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say every day she be givin’ it up.

Nate Dogg
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me.

Eminem
I’m a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about 4 or 5 minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don’t spit it, swallow, and I’ll finish

Yeah me and Nate D-O-double G
Lookin’ for a couple bitches with some double D’s
Pop a little champagne and a couple E’s
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party.

Nate Dogg
Have a party 
Turn the music up
Let’s get it started 
Go ahead shake your butt
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are ’bout it, ’bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won’t say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut. Would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine.

Eminem
Now imma hope you don’t get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don’t mind
I told him how you like it from behind.

Look, let me ask ya'll 
Should I stay and talk, or let this relationship fall 
I ain't down on what happened, my feelings crushed

Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo

If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic

"She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy 
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low 
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder 
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me.

Mother: Hi Justin! This is your mother. It's 2:33 on Monday afternoon. I was just calling to see how you were doing. You sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous too.I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too. You know I love ya! Take care honey I know you're under a lot of pressure. See ya. Bye, bye!

I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I'll never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away""
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?""

Hate me today

Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

"Yeah
It's my life
My own words I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor

And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy, look what I made."", dad's gotta go catch a plane

""Daddy, where's mommy? I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back 
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making mommy cry, why? Why is mommy crying?""
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying,
You always say that, you always say this is the last time.
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine.""

She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya.""

I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right,"" and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back 
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back

60,000 people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd

I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'

""You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin.
I get the point - fine, me and mommy are gone.""

But baby wait, ""It's too late dad, you made the choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real

I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it

The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain

Is everybody in?

She got me doin da dishes
Anythang she want for some kisses
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin like she want me
She cuttin off all my homies
Even all my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinking 'bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me...
And I'm takin everythang with me...
Well it all come down to her...

So we went our separate ways...
It's been a couple of days...
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gone do
And I'm feeling so free...
With nobody but me...
Now I can handle all my business
All my fellas can I get a witness
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her...
Now I'm leavin quickly...
Before she come and try to get me...
And I'm takin everythang with me...
Well it all come down to her...

"I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall

My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know

I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)
But do I make you proud?

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud?
But do I make you proud?
