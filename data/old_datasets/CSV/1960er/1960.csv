"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Faleena would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Faleena
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Faleena, the girl that I loved

So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for
Faleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Faleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Faleena, goodbye","['american', 'death by heart surgery']",567.0,15,1960,5.2,97.2,466,58,"{'neg': 0.16, 'neu': 0.679, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': -0.0451}",El Paso,1.7000000000000002,Marty Robbins,60,12

But then I hear your voice
And something stirs inside of me

No matter how I try

"In May of 1941 the war had just begun

The Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And ev'ry British seaman he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

We gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away the mighty Hood went down

"When I see my baby
What do I see?
Poetry
Poetry in motion

Poetry in motion, walkin' by my side
Her lovely locomotion keeps my eyes open wide
Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean could never move that way

I love every movement
There's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement
She's much too nice to rearrange

Poetry in motion, dancing close to me
A flower of devotion a-swaying gracefully

Oh, a-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
A-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
A-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa

Poetry in motion, see her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean could never move that way

I love every movement
There's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement
She's much too nice to rearrange

Poetry in motion, all that I adore
No number nine love potion could make me love her more
