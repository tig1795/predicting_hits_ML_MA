"Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To Sir, with love

The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart

"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door, ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet.""
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge.
Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.""

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the black-eyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense. Pass the biscuits, please.
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow.""
And Mama said it was a shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
He put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie. You know, it don't seem right.
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge.
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.""

Mama said to me, ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite.
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today.
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday. Oh, by the way,
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge.
And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge.""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge","['baroque pop', 'blue-eyed soul', 'classic pop and rock', 'contemporary folk', 'country', 'country pop', 'country soul', 'delta blues']",470.7,3,1967,6.0,86.71,359,33,"{'neg': 0.043000000000000003, 'neu': 0.92, 'pos': 0.037, 'compound': -0.21680000000000002}",Ode To Billie Joe,3.7,Bobby Gentry,51,3

"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

"You wander around
On your own little cloud
When you don't see the why
Or the wherefore

Ooh, you walk out on me
When we both disagree
'Cause to reason is not what you care for

I've heard it all a million times before
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

You try to be smart
Then you take it apart
'cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
Um-m-um-um-um-um
You don't realize
That it's all compromise
And the problems are so over-rated

Good-bye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go?

Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

Oh, oh, oh
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride
Nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Daytime turns me off, and I don't mean maybe
Nine-to-five ain't taking me where I'm bound
When it's done, I run out to see my baby
We get groovin' when the sun goes down

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up-, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation
It's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you

I'll talk about plans now, baby, I got plenty
Nothing ever seems to turn out the way it should
Talk about money, girl, I ain't got any
Seems like just one time I'm feelin' good

I thank the Lord for the night time
To forget the day
A day of up-, uptight time
Baby, chase it away
I get relaxation
It's a time to groove
I thank the Lord for the night time
I thank the Lord for you","['american', 'classic pop and rock', 'pop', 'rock']",191.7,100,1967,4.4,99.23,161,25,"{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.176, 'compound': 0.9618000000000001}",Thank The Lord For The Night Time,0.9,Neil Diamond,16,12
