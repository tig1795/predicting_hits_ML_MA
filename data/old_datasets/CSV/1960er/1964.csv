And get down on my knees and pray

I won her heart
Didn't think I'd do
But now I see
She's worse to him than me

Take his love instead
And one day she will see

And get down on her knees
Yeah, that's how it begins
She'll feel those needles and pins

And tell myself I'm wrong
I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up
And tell myself I'm strong
