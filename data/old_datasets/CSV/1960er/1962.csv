"(Roses are red, my love)
(Doo doo da doo)

A long, long time ago 
On graduation day 
You handed me your book 
I signed this way: 

""Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you.""

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name:

""Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you."" (as sweet as you)

Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter, dear
And I wrote back to you:

""Roses are red, my love.
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But luck may God bless you."" (may God bless you)

Is that your little girl? 
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too:

Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet, my love.
But not as sweet as you.""

And a scimitar by his side
And every evening about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde...and ride

Which is camel for, ""What the heck did he say anyway?"" 
Well.... 

He brought that camel to a screeching halt

Snuck around the corner and into the tent he went
There he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug
Wearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
And a bone in her nose ho, ho.

There she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty.

It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'

At some party where the fun runs wild
If tears start to flow and I fall apart
Please don't think you broke my heart

And a little bitta tear rolls down my cheek
Please don't think it's because I'm blue
Or that I'm still in love with you

And how the tears rolled down my face
It wasn't because you were leavin' me
I was happy because you were pleasing me

"My soul was a-swayin' to the beat of your heart
And your lips were sayin' that we won't dance apart
Now someone else is holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again., whoa oh no

Oh I've danced with others just to show I don't care
But my arms discovered that the thrill wasn't there
Unless my arms are holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again whoa oh no

I'll stay off the dance floor till mem'ries grow di-i-i-i-m

I'll survive seein' ya sighin' on that shoulder of his
Oh how I've been cryin' knowin' how sweet that is

"When you're young and so and love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people hurt us so
Only those in love would know
What a Town Without Pity can do..

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how bad we are...
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a Town Without Pity can do..

The young have problems Many problems
We need an understanding heart..
Why don't they help us, try to help us
Before this clay and granite planet falls apart...

Take these eager lips and hold me fast..
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two..
