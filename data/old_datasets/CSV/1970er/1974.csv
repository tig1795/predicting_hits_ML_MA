"Memories 
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were

Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply to choose to forget

So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were","['adult contemporary', 'american', 'easy listening soundtracks and musicals', 'pop', 'showtunes', 'vocal', 'yentle']",135.0,1,1974,4.0,91.78,101,18,"{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.8180000000000001, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9063}",The Way We Were,1.7000000000000002,Barbra Streisand,19,4
"Goodbye to you my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABCs
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees

Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed 
Were just seasons out of time

Goodbye papa, please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wonder how I got along

Goodbye papa, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Little children everywhere
When you see them, I'll be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song 
Like the seasons, have all gone

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song 
Like the seasons, have all gone

Goodbye Michelle, my little one
You gave me love and helped me find the sun
And every time that I was down
You would always come around
And get my feet back on the ground

Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers everywhere
I wish that we could both be there

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the stars we could reach
Were just starfish on the beach

We had joy, we had fun
We had seasons in the sun
But the wine and the song

Hello, everyone, this is your action news reporter with all the news
that is news across the nation, on the scene at the supermarket.  There
seems to have been some disturbance here.  Pardon me, sir, did you see
what happened?

(Witness):
Yeah, I did.  I's standin' overe there by the tomaters, and here he
come, running through the pole beans, through the fruits and vegetables,
nekkid as a jay bird.  And I hollered over t' Ethel, I said, ""Don't
look, Ethel!""  But it's too late, she'd already been incensed.

(Chorus)
Here he comes, look at that, look at that
There he goes, look at that, look at that
And he ain't wearin' no clothes

Oh yes, they call him the Streak
(Look at that, look at that)
Fastest thing on two feet
(Look at that, look at that)
He's just as proud as he can be
Of his anatomy
He goin' give us a peek

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Look at that, look at that)
He likes to show off his physique
(Look at that, look at that)
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around
Invitin' public critique

(Reporter):
This is your action news reporter once again and we're here at the gas
station.  Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?

(Witness):
Yeah, I did.  I's just in here gettin my car checked, he just appeared
out of the traffic.  Come streakin' around the grease rack there, didn't
have nothin' on but a smile.  I looked in there, and Ethel was gettin'
her a cold drink.  I hollered, ""Don't look, Ethel!""  But it was too
late.  She'd already been mooned.  Flashed her right there in front of
the shock absorbers.

(Chorus)
He ain't crude, look at that, look at that
He ain't lewd, look at that, look at that
He's just in the mood to run in the nude

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Look at that, look at that)
He likes to turn the other cheek
(Look at that, look at that)
He's always makin' the news
Wearin' just his tennis shoes
Guess you could call him unique

(Reporter):
Once again, your action news reporter in the booth at the gym, covering
the disturbance at the basketball playoff.  Pardon me, sir, did you see
what happened?

(Witness):
Yeah, I did.  Half time, I's just goin' down thar to get Ethel a snow
cone.  And here he come, right out of the cheap seats, dribbling, right
down the middle of the court.  Didn't have on nothing but his PF's.
Made a hook shot and got out through the concessions stand.  I hollered up
at Ethel, I said, ""Don't look, Ethel!""  But it was too late.  She'd
already got a free shot.  Grandstandin', right there in front of the
home team.

There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me

You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around

And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me

In the heat of a summer night

Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law

Through the streets of the old East Side
Till the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died
There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
"" 'Bout a hundred cops are dead"".
