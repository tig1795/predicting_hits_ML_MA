"Love, love will keep us together
Think of me babe whenever
Some sweet talkin' girl comes along, singin' a song
Don't mess around, you just gotta be strong

Just stop, 'cause I really love you
Stop, I been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

You (you, do do do) you belong to me now (do, do do do)
Ain't gonna set ya free now (do do do)
When those girls start hangin' around, talkin' me down
Hear with your heart and ya won't hear a sound

Just stop (stop, stop) 'cause I really love you (really love you)
Stop (stop, stop) I been thinkin' of you (been thinkin' of you)
Look in my heart and let love keep us together, whatever

Young and beautiful
But someday your looks'll be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turnin' you on
I will, I will, I will

I will be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I said it before and I'll say it again
While others pretend
I need ya now and I need ya then

Just stop (stop) 'cause I really love you (really love you)
Stop (stop) I been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks
Of Broadway

Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I don't really mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train
That's takin' the long way

And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon 
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
and murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen

To those of us who know the pain
of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown

That's a really nice place to go

Folks hoping you'd turn out cool

Toward the radio he's bound

And everyone thinks he died

With the best of country music, old and new 
You can hear your five selections for a quarter 
And somebody else's songs when yours are through 

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter 
And my friends around to help me ease the pain 
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song 
And here I am just missing you again

But I guess I'd better get myself together 
'Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind 
Just a note that said ""I'm sorry"" by your picture

Muggy nights,
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, Lord, you really should have been there,
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer,
And I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately,
My friend's out there,
Rolling 'round the basement floor

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied,
Altar-bound, hypnotized,
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly,
And butterflies are free to fly,
Fly away, high away bye bye

Of evening showers,
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn outplayed by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it
Listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music is still alive

Into the deep end of the river,
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning
With a truck to take me home
