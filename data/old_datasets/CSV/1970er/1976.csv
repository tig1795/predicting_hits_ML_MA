"You'd think that people would've had enough of silly love songs
But I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that? I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

(I love you) I can't explain, the feeling's plain to me, now can't you see?
(I love you) Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me, now can't you see?
What's wrong with that? I need to know
'Cause here I go again

I love you
I love you

Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly
Love isn't silly at all

How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?

"What's the sense in sharing this one and only life,
Endin' up just another lost and lonely wife?
You'll count up the years, and they will be filled with tears...

Love only breaks up to start over again;
You'll get the babies, but you won't have your man,
While he's busy loving every woman that he can... uh-huh...

Say I'm gonna leave a hundred times a day;
It's easier said than done, when you just can't break away! (When you just can't break away!)

Ooh, young hearts run free;
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...
My man and me...

Ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true;
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you...
Don't love you...

It's high time now, just one crack at life;
Who wants to live in, in trouble and strife?
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me... mmm...

I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days,
Encourage the babies every time they say,
""Self-preservation is what's really going on today...""

Say I'm gonna turn loose a thousand times a day,
But how can I turn loose when I just can't break away! (When I just can't break away!)

Oh, young hearts run free;
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me...

Of people to meet

You've gotta spend the night
Staying in touch with the street

When you're surrounded by friends
