"Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax baby and draw that blind

Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen off that pretty French gown
Let me pour you a good long drink
Ooh baby, don't you hesitate 'cause

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

C'mon angel my hearts on fire
Don't deny your man's desire
You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside

Tonight's the night
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

Don't say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the night's too old

Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil

Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home

And soon it will render

He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused; he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shakin', his big heart was breakin'

But this time your hurtin' won't heal

I called her up, I was all out of breath, I said,

And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I got to do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?

"Well, it's been building up inside of me
 For, oh, I don't know how long
 I don't know why
 But I keep thinkin'
 Somethings bound to go wrong

 But she looks in my eyes
 And makes me realize
 When she says
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Everything will turn out alright
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 (Baby)

 Each morning I awake and fine
 The sunlight softly shining in her hair
 And then I realize that I'm only
 Thinkin' that she really doesn't care
 There's magic in her eyes
 That makes me come alive
 When she says

 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Everything will turn out alright
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby

 She told me Baby, when you leave today
 Just take along my love with you
 And if you knew how much I loved you
 Baby nothing could go wrong with you
 Oh what she does to me
 When she makes love to me
 And she says

 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby
 (Don't worry baby)
 Everything will turn out alright
 (Don't worry baby)
 Don't worry baby

"No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you

We just have to face it, this time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

Mem'ries (Memories), good days (Good days)
Bad days (Bad days)
They'll be (They'll be), with me (With me)
Always

In these old familiar rooms children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you

We just have to face it, this time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you

"How much love do you need 
Before you give your love to me 
How much time before it grows 
How much love I wanna know 

What can I do what can I say 
The last thing I want is to drive you away 
How much love does it take 
How much love for heaven sake 

How much love how much love 
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate 
How much love how much love how much love 

Am I tryin' too hard 
Give me some kind of clue 
There must be a way to get through to you 
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate 
Do I rush right in or do I wait 

How much love how much love 
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate 
How much love how much love how much love
