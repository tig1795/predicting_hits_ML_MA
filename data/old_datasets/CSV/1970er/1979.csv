Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

Have you heard about the new dance craze?
Listen to us, I'm sure you'll be amazed
Big fun to be had by everyone
It's up to you, it surely can be done

Young and old are doing it, I'm told
Just one try, and you too will be sold
It's called le freak, they're doing it night and day
Allow us, we'll show you the way

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, check the rhyme
Come on along and have a real good time

Like the days of stomping at the Savoy
Now we freak, oh, what a joy
Just come on down, two 54
Find a spot out on the floor

Ah, freak out!
Le freak, c'est Chic
Freak out!

Now freak!

I said freak!

Now freak!

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, check the ride
Come on along and have a real good time

Like the days of stomping at the Savoy
Now we freak, oh, what a joy
Just come on down, two 54
Find a spot out on the floor

Ah, freak out!

"Surely, sugar, hmm

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She sits alone, waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all her questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

""If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know""
""If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so
Tell me so, baby""

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
""Come on, honey, let's spend the night together""
""Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother""
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

""If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, honey, tell me so""
""If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar, let me know""
Ooh

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
""Relax, baby, now we're all alone""
Ow

They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty, and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, ""I'm sorry, but I'm out of milk and coffee""
""Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie""

""If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know""
""If you really need me, just reach out and touch me

"At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go walk out the door

I said, I was down and out with the blues
I felt no man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so jive

And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

I will find a way, find a way...

Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end

He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willin' to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said: ""Boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said: ""My name's Johnny and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been!""

Johnny, rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case and he said: ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the devil finished Johnny said:
""Well, you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet

A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings

Yes, I'll be on my way
I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time


Sail on down the line
Ain't it funny how the time can go
Friends say they told me so
But it doesn't matter

It was plain to see that
A small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinking

I gave you my heart and
I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah

I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time, yeah


I gave you my heart and
I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah

Got nothin' else to lose
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time, yeah

Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on, sugar
Good times never felt so good

Sail on

"Didn't I hear you cry this morning, didn't I feel you weep?
Teardrops flowin' down on me, like rivers in my sleep.
And in my dream of laughter, you came creepin' with your fears.
Telling me your sorrows, in the tracings of your tears.

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody, don't cry to me, no
Don't cry to me, no

Didn't I hear your voice this morning, didn't you call my name?
I heard you whisper softly, but the words were never plain.
And in your dream of darkness, I came shinin' like the sun.
Waiting for the laughter, but the laughter never comes.

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody, dont cry to me, no
Dont cry to me, no

Didn't you feel alone this morning, didn't you need a friend?
And in your darkest hour, you came runnin' back again

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
That's a strange way to tell me you love me","['country rock', 'pop rock', 'soft rock']",235.8,100,1979,6.0,103.63,211,21,"{'neg': 0.124, 'neu': 0.618, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.9902000000000001}",Strange Way,1.3,Firefall,19,9
