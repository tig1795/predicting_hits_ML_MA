"Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take

Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And Mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

"First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind

All alone, I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Wrap around, take a hold of my heart

What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life

Take your passion
And make it happen

You can dance right through your life

"Travelling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said:

""Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover.""

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscles
I said, ""Do you speak-a my language?""
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said:

""I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder.
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover.""

Lying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw and not much to say
I said to the man, ""Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty.""
And he said:

""Oh! Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder.
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?

I get off on screaming guitar.
Like the way it gets me every time it hits me.
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart.

Feels like we're falling into the arms of the night,
So if you're not ready, don't be holdin' me so tight.
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain;
Here's what you're gettin' and I don't want to change, I don't want to change.

I get off on 57 Chevys;
I get off on screaming guitar.
Like the way it gets me every time it hits me.
I've got a rock and roll, I've got a rock and roll heart.

I don't need to glitter, no Hollywood,
All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good.

"Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems the natural thing to do

Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too

Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds
When I make love to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you, tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new

Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you

"I can tell you that love
Is too deep to be played on
Down the line, you'd find
Time would reveal who to count on

I would build you up

If you fall in love with me

If you're having
Second thoughts from the past
I can cool you out
I've been there before
Right down to the core
I can sing and shout

I can't hold back what I feel
I bring experience
I'll be your rock
When Gibraltar falls
