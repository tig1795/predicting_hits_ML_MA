"Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo's standoff sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne
She got Bette Davis eyes
She'll take a tumble on you
Roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you, when she snows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious, and she knows just

There's only you in my life

You're every breath that I take

You have come into my life and made me whole

When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

How you keep on moving

And thought it over

That it's never over
Only set aside

My thoughts are only you
Wandering through the
Memories in my mind

How could love so real
Have gone so empty
I just keep wondering why
Will I ever find the love
We shared together, you and I

Oh, it's you, sweet baby
Though we've had
Such a long hard road
To climb, sweet baby
Only hoping it's not
Too late to try again

"Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged

Went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

She said she'd married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie

I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I
Saw doubt or gratitude

She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another 'auld lang syne'

The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away

Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home

Of facing rainy days
And somehow we survive

We keep the feelings warm
Protect them from the storm
Until our time arrives

Then one day the sun appears
And we come shining through those lonely years

I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected

Got rained on too
And made it through

When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid

Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade

'Cause when I chased my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say

See what else your old heart can take
Boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God, I hope he comes back soon""

And everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown

There's plenty of dives to be someone you're not
Just say you're looking for something you might have forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home

Just tell 'em your trying to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
Boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God, I hope he comes back soon""

Guess you got me in your spell
But I think that I'll be allright
Even if I don't get well....

Hey, Miss Sun,
What could I say
I tried to hold you but the moon got in the way
It won't be long before the morning has you back in my arms....

I can still remember
What you told me with your eyes
One kiss
Now it's down to this
Guess it's time you realize

"Time it goes on waits for nobody special
In the prime of my life I'll remember you
Living and breathing and some misbelieving
But I can't hold you woman, no piece of you
You were the magic , my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time 
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right 

Time it goes on waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistaking
But I'll follow you woman , eternally
You were the magic , my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right , all right 

Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love 

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right
