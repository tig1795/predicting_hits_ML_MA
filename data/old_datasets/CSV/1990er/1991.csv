I still remember just like it was yesterday

"(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
(On your loving)

Verse 1
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

Verse 2
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty , you're ready for lovin'
You're real independent so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay,
(Oooh you love me) come around my way

CHORUS:
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around-the-way girl
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)

Verse 3
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby-hair pumping, lip gloss is shinin'
I think you in the mood for winin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renée, I love you (smooch)
You're from around the way

CHORUS
I need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl
That's the one for me
She don't love him
(You got me shook)
I need an around-the-way girl, an around-the-way girl
Fine as can be
(Oooh you love me)
She oh, yea

Can you tell me what it is we really want to find

I say, nothin' comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sittin' idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothin' comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're lookin' for still isn't found

VERSE 2:

I'm tired of foolin' around I said I want to do it
I learned my lesson young I say, if you really want two have fun
Go for it and when you win, say ""I go for it""

"Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life

So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over
Or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind

Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you in silent lucidity

I can't do this
Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Help me

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down and a new world will begin
Living twice at once, you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly

A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive
You can be the guide but

I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you","['american', 'heavy metal', 'metal', 'progressive metal', 'rock and indie']",359.1,82,1991,4.4,99.23,296,46,"{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.9622}",Silent Lucidity,0.9,Queensryche,36,10

You get her name and number then left feelin' real mellow

exactly

And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
