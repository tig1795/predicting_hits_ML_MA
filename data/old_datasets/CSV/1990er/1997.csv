"Every day I wake up
I hope I'm dreaming
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep going
It's like I feel empty inside without you being here

I would do anything, man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit up, shit don't mean nothin'
I saw your son today
He look just like you
You was the greatest
You'll always be the greatest
I miss you, Big
Can't wait till that day when I see your face again
I can't wait till that day when I see your face again

Yeah, this right here goes out to
Everyone who's lost someone that they truly loved
Check it out

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dreams

In the future can't wait to see 
If you'll open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometime the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you

Thinking of the day
When you went away
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you

We miss you, Big

It's kinda hard wit' you not around
Know you in Heaven smilin' down
Watching us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Till the day we meet again
In my heart is where I keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe

My thoughts, Big, I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us and the six shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they received you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make (I'll miss you)
Every single day
Every time I pray
I'll be missing you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Thinking of the day
When you went away (you)
What a life to take
What a bond to break
I'll be missing you (somebody tell me why)

On that morning
When this life is over
I know, I'll see your face

Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every single day
Every night I pray

Every step I take
Every move I make

Don't leave me out in the rain

Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now

Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?""

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me.
You make me

Verse 1:
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how you make me wanna...

Chorus:
...Leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me.

Verse 2:
Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you.
What should I do?
Should I tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I do exactly what I feel inside?
Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together.

Chorus:
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you see what you do?
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with oh baby
Start a new relationship with you this is what you do
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me.

Verse 3:
At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried
I tried to fight it
But the feelin's just too strong.

Chorus:
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with see what you do?
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me

She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round, and she goes down on me

And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take

Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again, and then I bumped again
I said

How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right

And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress

One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now

Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye

"I long for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time

Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do

When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

Remember the nights
When we closed our eyes (we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do

When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe

When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume

When summer burns with heat

"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Remmy
I didn't mind it when he fucked me from behind
It felt fine 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the jeep
Told him ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin' ""Gimme,""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' the mike
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that could have made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy

I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't cap
I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I aint frontin'
The sex was whack, a four stroke creep
I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double blast
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones
I'll give you ten Gs nigga if you leave me alone, screamin'

I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right

The moral of the story is this
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, and big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I can be blunt'
I treat it like it's precious, I aint gonna front
For limp dick niggas, that's frontin' like they really
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

"Intro:

To the L, to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house

Chorus:

Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Verse One:

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred, I'm a veteran
which means that I've been in the game too long
Since the days of Paper Thin way back when I've been putting it
down ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of
the M I C, I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request, You like the rhyme
Bite if you dare, I get the paper so I don't care, Fly that's me
The epitomy of what a real MC is supposed to be, Fucking you up
everytime that I drop, Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well and if you take a look
it ain't hard to tell that I

Chorus (repeat)

Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
it's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from but I'm resting in Studio City
for the fun, if you don't understand just say you don't (nah!)
and don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best, West to East
See East to West, ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.  Cause it's crazy how I
get you captured with my tactics, I got many witnesses
that can back this ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
make the ill type moves, I guide the best and ride it well
and if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Chorus (repeat)

Get out my shit, Please let me be, I don't see why -- you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that, Trying to get over
like a fat rat, but I understand -- I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop, it goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver, chillin with
a pina colada, kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I gotta
lot of gear from everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why!  5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, What they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew, Cause I ride the beat
and I ride it well and if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

You don't even know you're being unkind,
So much for all your high brow Marxist ways,

If you ain't peeped then you must be drinking
And smokin'
Pretending that your loc'n but you're broken
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and
Little Jimmy got life
And Tamika around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy?
'Cause now you done lost a hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a bustler
And though I got love for you
I know I can't trust you
'Cause my crew is rollin' hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters

By a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cause it's way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster 'cause we got a later start
But I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
And if everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag colour deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the times somebody up there still love us

You need to loosen up
And live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feel
And for your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that
Too busy tryin' a stack
And keep up with the Jones's taking advantage of your own
The realist homies that you been knowin for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to what's right 
When it's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous 
Yes I know time seems strife
And problems seem endless
But in times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in drive and stop by my side

If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there

And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked or the straight and narrow
We got one push to give and one life to live
So stand up for something or lay down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make your peace

It's not a thought I couldn't take

I knew i could regain my sight

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
he mistaked me for somebody who was liable
for all tha many murders l.a and war fields

streets keep souls
young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist

I keep away from fools
they do crime and it attracts cops

there they go with they assumpitons

why you wanna pull me over?

then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today

Then he give a woman 25 a curfew
