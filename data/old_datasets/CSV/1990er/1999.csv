No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back

I need time to move on
I need a love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

All you have to do is believe it when you pray

And then you will see the morning will come
And everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'm your angel

I saw the teardrops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find, ooh
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

And then you will see the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me
How can I make you see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'm your angel

And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive

And when it seems as if your end is drawing near (end is drawing here)
Don't you dare give up the fight (oh no)
Just put your trust beyond the skies

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call
I am your angel

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel, I'll be

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry

I've seen a loser win and a sad man grin, I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad and the downside of up and everything between
I licked the silver spoon, drank from the golden cup, smoked the finest green
I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times before I broke they heart
You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start

I knew this kid named Max, he used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late, he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs
Till late one night there was a big gun fight and Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit and wound up dead

Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain
You know it crumbles that way, at least that's what they say when you play the game

The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you and him then give him a little trim

To begin, how you think you really goin' to pretend
Like you wasn't down when you called him again?
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably  again

Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?

Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend

You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem

Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, popping yin (Like you got Yen)

Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids

But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men

In the Hollywood hills and the boulevards
Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger and
Sonny and Cher

She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't
Relax
And just before she hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby
I sing:

Everything's gonna be all right
Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye

She still lives with her mom outside the city
Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her she's so pretty
But she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while
'Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town

The name is Krayzie ""Big Bad Ass"" Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole, along
With some cash, even took the mayor's daughter

Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it so I brought her
Then, got myself into a whole heap of trouble, double-crossed by the law
So there's nobody to run to, yeah, it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
Outlaw--call him Leather Face

I'm headed for the West, heard they got
A couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well, uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown

So, I continue my mission it's gettin' dark
So I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns
They like to catch ya, then they rob and split
I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips

All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse""Whoa, Nellie! Who in the bushes?
You better speak out or I'm a let my shotgun song sing out""
Who is this? I hope this ain't the law
Jump out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun

""C'mon out, right now, I'm gettin' angry""
Took a step back, 'cause it could get dangerous
Thug Queen, ""the horse stealer""
""Please don't shoot it's just me, Thug Queen, the horse-stealer""

""Then, why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes?""
""I'm wanted in four counties for armed robbery
Killed to two sheriffs, six of his best men with my hand, stole two horses
Thought you was the law, that's why I jumped in the bushes""
""Goodness"", now, she was hotter than the barrel on fire
But I could use her for the job, so I told her to ride, ""C'mon""

""May I ask you what you headed to the West for?""
""I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you're down, you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
""Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you're with it""

""We out before the sun rise, gotta stallion for your partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine, down for whatever, let's ride, let's ride""
""These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive, we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the mornin' for details and hook-up""

""Rise and shine! Good mornin', howdy
Nine o'clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now, I done came a long way, and I don't wanna be late""
""Tell him I make ya  'cause you know we ain't""
""Move out! Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup""

I'm peepin' Krayzie's wanted poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble around here pretty soon
Glance across the room, I see this youngster getting ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life

So, I approach him, and I pause ""Look, man, I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws come messin' up this master plan?""
Since he already rowdy, I just asked the man, ""Hey, you want some work?
Well, partner, put in your bid, and by the way, now what's your name?""
""They call me Layzie the Kid""

""The name's Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlaw, everyday on the front page Mister Kid
If you give me the lowdown, me and Black Jack
Be ready for the showdown with two double-barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together I'm purty clever""
""So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon, because it's all goin' down""
I heard a guy run in the bar screamin', ""Krayzie's in town""

""Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside, and don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses""
Step inside the bar, ""Lay the Kid, you son of a gun""
""Hey, man, I'm glad you made it safely, now let's go have some fun
And this my partner Powder, he's a young gun""

""Howdy""
""Mighty glad to meet ya, son, oh yeah
You know I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen, the horse peddler, straggler, just met her""
""Howdy, partner, already got the horses saddled up""
""I hope you good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up""

""Now, y'all, it's gon' be gettin' dark real soon""

All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(Puffy)
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, opposites attract but
We one and the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play witchu, I wanna lay witchu,
Stay witchu,pray witchu, grow old and gray witchu,
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
'Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do

Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do

Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

I'm that light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair,
I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

"I never saw the end in sight, fools are kinda blind
Thought everything was going all right, but I was running out of time
'Cause you have one foot out the door, I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away, here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read them everyday
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
Every single word is true, and I think you need to know
So use it as a book mark, stick it on your frigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantle where you can see it for sure

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read them everyday
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

You can find the chisel, I can find the stone
Folks'll be a-readin these words, long after we're gone

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away

"Many nights we prayed, with no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts, a hopeful song we barely understood
Now we are not afraid, although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long before we knew we could

Oh yes, there can be miracles when you believe 
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe, mmm, yeah

Ohh, in this time of fear, when prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds, too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here, my heart so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles when you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill (Mmm)

Who knows what miracles you can achieve? (You can achieve)
When you believe, somehow you will, you will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
Ohh, but when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still resilient voice says hope is very near 

There can be miracles
Miracles
When you believe
Boy, when you believe, ohh
Though hope is frail, it's hard...
Hard to kill, yeah

Who knows what miracles you can achieve? 
You can achieve, ohh
When you believe, somehow you will
Somehow, somehow, somehow

Somehow you will
I know, I know, know
You will when you believe
When you believe...

Ohh, you will when you...

Lyrics by:  Evan Rogers, Carl Sturken

Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words how I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole.
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

I never thought that love could feel like this.
Then you changed my world with just one kiss.
How can it be, that right here with me,
there's an angel, it's a miracle.

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep.
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep.
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true,
God must have spent a little more time on you.

In all of creation,  all things great and small,
You are the one that surpasses them all.
More precious than any diamond or pearl,
They broke the mold when you came in this world.

And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without.
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child,
It's deep inside, and leaves me purified.

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep.
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep.
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true, 
God must have spent a little more time on you.

I never thought that love could feel like this,
then you changed my world with just one kiss.
How can it be, that right here with me,
There's an angel, it's a miracle.

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep.
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep.
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true,
God must have spent a little more time on you.
God must have spent a little more time on you.","['adult contemporary', 'american', 'beach', 'country', 'country rock', 'rock']",365.4,100,1999,5.2,97.2,308,36,"{'neg': 0.07100000000000001, 'neu': 0.734, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.9887}",God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You,1.7000000000000002,Alabama,23,15
