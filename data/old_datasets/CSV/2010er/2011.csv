Yo, I'm runnin' through these hoes like Drano

On the rise to the top, no ""Led"" in our ""Zeppelin"", hey

Shufflin', shufflin'

Step up fast
And be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We gettin' money, don't be mad
And now stop - ...hatin' is bad

Please fill up my cup, don't mess around

"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go ""Ah, ah, ah!""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go ""Ah, ah, ah!""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane, comes a rainbow

Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework

Signed her name on my heart with an XO
Love so sweet, got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes

Meantime I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line

Somethin 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down, yo
My heart's pumpin out louder than electro
She got me feelin like (Mr. Roboto)

Oh, baby, I can't come down so, please, come help me out
You got me feelin' high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions

Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'

This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

Eminem:
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward, uh

Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music

There is or there ever will be, disagree
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks

I love it when I tell 'em shove it 'cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
'Cuz he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz, and now you wonder

Why he does it, how he does it, wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it

What difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls
If this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage

And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9"" but I feel like I'm 6'8""

By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and
Buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me ""Slow down, boy, you going to blow it""

And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him to know it

I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
'Till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years

I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box

Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao

Ya'll are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive

And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV Awards gag

Bruno Mars:
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight we're alright
So hold up your lights
Let it shine

When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate

But I will never change
And I’m on my way


Let's go...
Yeah
You’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials

Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack

I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to Earth

I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed

Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying

I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed

Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man!

I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out

Staying up, playing back myself leavin'

And I think about summer, all the beautiful times

And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was ""Goodbye""

Probably mindless dreaming

Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her

Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway

Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away

Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair

Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Change you're geography
Maybe you might be

And I tell her ""Go on! Pop that pussy for me.""
Haters can't see me but bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back

I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and imma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen

Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!


She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back
Told me ""Baby it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby you know the deal

"We were sittin' up there on your momma's roof
Talkin' 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move
Oh, but you were so shy and so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me...

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're 'bout to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not

It was the best dang kiss that I'd ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask
For your hand
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band
And I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not

So, we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried when you walked down the aisle
When the preacher man said say I Do
I did, and you did, too
Then I lifted that veil and saw your pretty smile
And I said...

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what
Look at all the love that we've got
And it ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not

Yeah baby I love you a lot

Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive

One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

Run like poison in my blood

Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the tail lights shinin' through the windowpane

He said, ""I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?""
She said, ""You're a ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'""

At a truck stop diner just outside o' Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

He said, ""I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather

Well, it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover, I'm a runner
And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby

Oh, I wanna see you again

Born for leavin'

When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again

Like I never had it at all

Okay, now where that alcohol? You ain't even got to ask
'Cause I'mma drink it all like, like it's my last

She even look better by the end of my glass
See I just walked in fresher than the Certs off in this muthafucka
I'mma need the baddest broad to twerk off in this muthafucka
I'mma go hard 'til it hurts off in this muthafucka
I'm a boss so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
The work, and I can get you anything you want
I could, I could, I could put you on

Do it like Beyoncé and put it on Sean

Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us

And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All all up in my face like you remember who I am

Up in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Man I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected
Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
I'mma just tell you, it's everything that I expected
