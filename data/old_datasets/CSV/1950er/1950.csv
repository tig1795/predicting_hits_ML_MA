"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there

Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there

Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

"I wanna be Loved
By Andrews Sisters

Oooo-ooooh

Oooo-ooooh

I wanna be loved,
(oooh)
With inspiration!
(oooh)
I wanna be loved,
Starting tonight!
(oooh)

Instead of merely
(oooh)
Holding conversation,
(oooh)
Hold me tight!

I wanna be kissed,
(aaaah)
Until I tingle!
(aaaah)
I wanna be kissed,
(aaaah)
Starting tonight!
(aaaah)

Embrace until 
our heartbeats intermingle,
Wrong or right!

I feel like acting my age!
I'm passed the stage of merely turtle-doving!
(Be careful! Be careful what you do!)
I'm in no mood to resist,
And I insist the world owes me a loving!
(oooh)

I wanna be thrilled
(oooh)
To desperation!
(oooh)
I wanna be thrilled,
(oooh)
starting tonight!
(Love me! Love me! Love me!)

With every kind of wonderful sensation!
I wanna be loved!
(aaaah)

I feel like acting my age!
I'm passed the stage of merely turtle-doving!
I'm in no mood to resist,
And I insist the world owes me a loving!

I wanna be thrilled to desperation!
(I wanna be thrilled!I wanna be thrilled!)
I wanna be thrilled, starting tonight!
(I wanna be thrilled tonight!)

"I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced her to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling on the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz

I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced her to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

"Each time I hold someone new
My arms grow cold aching for you
No one can take your place
Darling in my embrace
I'll never be free

And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try
No one can satisfy this longing in me

I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
How can I be free when I still remember
How you could thrill me with a sigh

Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free","['death by liver failure', 'spiritual']",135.9,20,1950,4.4,99.23,117,18,"{'neg': 0.167, 'neu': 0.602, 'pos': 0.231, 'compound': 0.8842000000000001}",I'll Never Be Free,0.9,Tennessee Ernie Ford,10,3

"Hoop dee doo, hoop dee doo,  
I hear a polka an' my troubles are through!  
Hoop dee doo, hoop dee dee,  
this kind of music is like heaven to me!  

Hoop dee doo, hoop dee doo,  
it's got me higher than a kite,  
hand me down my soup an' fish  
I am gonna get my wish, hoop dee doin' it tonight!  

When there's a trombone playin'  
I get a thrill, I always will!  
When there's a concertina, stretched about a  mile,  
I always smile, 'cause that's my style! 

When there's a fiddle in the middle  
oh! it really is a riddle, how he plays a tune so sweet!  
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die,  
lead me to the floor an' hear me yell for more  
'cause I'm a hoop dee doin' kind of guy! 

Hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) 
I hear a polka an' my troubles are through! ( Ha, ha, ha ha! ) 
Hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) hoop dee dee ( Hoop dee dee! ) 
this kind of music is like heaven to me!  

Hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) hoop dee doo ( Hoop dee doo! ) 
it's got me higher than a kite,  


hand me down my soup an' fish  
I am gonna get my wish, hoop dee doin' it tonight!  

When there's a trombone playin'  
He gets a thrill! I get a thrill, I always will! He always will! 
When there's a concertina . . . stretched about a  mile,  
I always smile ( You'll see him smile! ) 'cause that's my style! ( 'Cause that's his style! ) 

When there's a fiddle in the middle  
oh! it really is a riddle, how he plays a tune so sweet!  
Plays a tune so sweet that we could die! 
Oh yes! . . . lead me to the floor an' hear me yell for more  
'cause I'm a hoop dee doin' kind of guy! 

 

Hoop dee doo, hoop dee doo,  
it's got us higher than a kite,  
we're in clover, we're in bloom  
when we're dancin' give us room  
hoop dee doin' it with all of our might,  
rain may fall an' snow may come  
nothin's gonna stop us from 
hoop dee doin' it, hoop dee doin' it,  
hoop dee doin' it . . . tonight!

"i love those dear hearts and gentle people
who live in my home town
because those dear hearts and gentle people
will never ever let you down

they read the good book 
from fri till monday
that's how the weekend goes
i've got a dream house
i'll build there one day
with picket fence and ramblin rows

i feel so welcome each time i return
that my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown
i love the dear hearts and gentle people
who live and love in my home town

there's a place i'd like to go 
and it's back in idaho
where you're friendly neighbors smile and say hello
it's a pleasure and a treat 
to meandor down the street 
that's why i want the whole wide world to know
i love those dear hearts 
i love the gentle people
(who live in my home town)
because those dear hearts and gentle people 
will never ever let you down

they read the good book

"My heart knows what the wild goose knows,
I must go where the wild goose goes.
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest? 

Tonight I heard the wild goose cry,
Wingin' north in the lonely sky.
Tried to sleep, it weren't no use,
'Cause I am a brother to the old wild goose, 

(Oh, my heart knows what the wild goose knows,)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
(Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?)
(A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?) 

Woman was kind and true to me.
She thinks she loves me, the more fool she.
She's got a love that ain't no use,
To love a brother of the old wild goose. 

(My heart knows what the wild goose knows,)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
(Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?)
(A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?)
(Oh, you wild goose.) 

The cabin is warm and the snow is deep,
I got a woman who lies asleep.
She'll wake at tomorrow's dawn,
She'll find, poor critter, that her man is gone.
(Oh, you wild goose.) 

My heart knows what the wild goose knows,
I must go where the wild goose goes.
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest?
Let me fly, let me fly, let me fly away. 

Spring is comin' and the ice will break,
I can't linger for a woman's sake.
She'll see a shadow pass overhead.
She'll find my feathers beside my bed. 

(My heart knows what the wild goose knows,)
(And I must go where the wild goose goes.)
